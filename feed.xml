        <title>What happens before an agile retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I share what happens before I facilitate an agile retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most team I joined approach retrospectives as something that has to be done once a week in 1 hour and you don’t need any preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience that’s when retrospectives yield more basic results and in the worst cases become counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a retrospective–any meeting in my opinion–you must prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted you can’t come up with a plan that’s perfect. You work in a complex adaptive system so be ready for the unexpected. But you can take care of some due diligence and I’ll explain my approach in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question is what’s your role? Are you an external facilitator? A team member? A lead developer, product manager scrum master? If you feel like you’re overstepping your role by following this advice maybe treat it like an experiment. See how it goes. For the longest time I was a developer when I designed and facilitated my team retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re all biased but if you’re a scrum master or a team member probably even more. Be aware of that and maybe ask for a co-facilitator or co-designer external to the team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-a-retrospective-purpose&quot;&gt;Is there a retrospective purpose?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With teams of 6/10 I like to run short 1:1s or watercooler convos about what’s on the team member’s minds. If I see a pattern I propose that as the retrospective theme before the retrospective. Always check with the group before making that call final and designing the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip I learned the hard way: When you focus your retrospective on a theme you must have a way for the little low hanging fruit to be tackled. I like to do that in short 10/15m daily retrospectives. Those are action item focused. The themed retrospective is focused on reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme might be coming from the person “leading” the team, or if you’re an external facilitator from the stakeholder that brought you in. If you have time try to check in with the team anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That theme should hint at the purpose. &lt;strong&gt;You can do this investigation inside a retrospective that has purpose of “improving what we did this iteration” but you’d spend time doing that sifting instead of reflecting.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s very contextual sometime you might want the group to do that but in my experience I prefer to prepare a theme before. And if the group has a topic or a theme emerging different than what was planned I go with it. It’s their meeting. If the majority of the room expresses desire to explore other direction. This is where you–the facilitator–need to get out of the group’s way. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re a product manager, scrum master, tech lead that’s gonna be very hard to let go of your bias and your agenda&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the retrospective design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-retrospective-design&quot;&gt;The retrospective design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so that you don’t pick a random format on retromat print it and walk in the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few questions that I like to ask once the theme is defined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who’s gonna be there?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are we taking their time?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do we want to get out of this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are we getting there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last question is where I design the retrospective with activities that fit the group and the context. &lt;strong&gt;This is the plan and no plan survives contact with the enemy. So don’t be married to it.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s where the complexity of this facilitation job is. And why I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void of context they might not give a lot of insights but these are examples of retrospectives design I helped other folks with. Those sessions would take anything from 15 minutes to 30/40 minutes. Groups size were between 6 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This helped a new facilitator gently shift away from pure mad/sad/glad whack-a-mole retro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This retrospective design was focused on a specific incident. I asked a bit of the history and then I designed the retro with the person calling the meeting.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This retrospective design was focused on manager / reports dynamics.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-2.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Digging out some of the topics.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-2.10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This section was focused on way to visualize their current experiements data.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-2.20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We came up with using colors and post it-s divided in pies to quickly eyeball data.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/what-happens-before-an-agile-retrospective/design-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This is from a leadership offsite that I didn&#39;t facilitate. This person asked to bounce off ideas and I believe we came up with a better structure. A reminder to ask for help when you&#39;re designing your sessions!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I sparked some intrest in dedicating some time finding a theme and designing your next retrospective? Are you already doing it? How much time do you dedicate to it? Who helps you? Leave a comment or a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Make your retrospective facilitation even more effective? Here&#39;s 4 things to look at</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I refer to retrospectives as a type of meeting inspired by the 12th agile principle “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many factors–specific to your context–can reduce the effectiveness of a retrospective and cause frustration and mistrust in the group. &lt;strong&gt;In this brief blog post I will describe how psychological safety, purpose, preparedness and collaboration can help make your retrospectives even more effective&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to highlight this is not a checklist. And depending on what system/subsystem your retrospective is working with you might need to switch between lens/approaches for complicated or complex domains. I’ll probably followup on that in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is for retrospective facilitators and regular team members that want to take on that role. You don’t need to be a trained facilitator, scrum master or product manager to introduce changes and make your retrospective even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;psychological-safety&quot;&gt;Psychological Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Edmondson has done extensive research since the 90s on the subject–and published a book in 2018–&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247&quot;&gt;The Fearless Organization&lt;/a&gt;–Norm Kerth talks about a “Create Safety” exercise in his seminal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Project-Retrospectives-Handbook-Team-Reviews/dp/0932633447&quot;&gt;Project retrospectives&lt;/a&gt; book published in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt your retrospective is a blame game more than a reflection? Let me start from the foundation. &lt;strong&gt;Your retrospective outcomes will always be subpar if your team or organization does not support psychological safety&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are punished when speaking up they will withhold information or play the blame game fostering a low energy retrospective. Improving psychological safety at the organizational level is outside the purpose of this post but &lt;strong&gt;there are strategies you can use to assess and improve psychological safety at the team level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assess-the-team-psychological-safety&quot;&gt;Assess the team psychological safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by collecting data on the psychological safety level of the group. &lt;strong&gt;Try to have&lt;/strong&gt; one-on-ones with team members before the retrospective and take notes about their feelings.   &lt;strong&gt;Try to run an anonymous activity&lt;/strong&gt; (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/en/?id=1&quot;&gt;Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/en/?id=130&quot;&gt;Elephant in the room&lt;/a&gt;) when you set the stage of your retrospective to anonymously collect the safety levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the the psychological safety level is low–say a room full of Prisoners in &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/en/?id=1https://retromat.org/en/?id=1&quot;&gt;ESVP&lt;/a&gt;–you should switch the focus of the retrospective to increase the safety level. Try to run an anonymous brainstorm on “what is one thing that would have to change to make you all not be prisoners?”. &lt;strong&gt;It’s possible that the outcome of the whole retrospective will be a team norm document to ensure people feel comfortable to speak up… and that’s great!&lt;/strong&gt; If you decide to continue with the original retrospective plan–despite a room full of disengaged folks–remind the group they will have a chance at the end of retro to provide feedback to make the next one safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establish-a-safe-space-with-the-retrospective-prime-directive&quot;&gt;Establish a safe space with the Retrospective Prime Directive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a multitude of activities to set a safe stage for your retrospective, one is to read “The prime directive” by Norm Kerth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some groups printing the directive, reading it and asking for a verbal “yes I believe it”–or alternatively “I believe for the duration/sake of this retrospective”–is sufficient to set a safe positive stage. In more dis-engaged groups some will say yes just to move on… but they truly believe someone messed up… they truly believe it’s someone’s fault. At times their fault. &lt;strong&gt;What do you believe as the facilitator?&lt;/strong&gt; If you–the retrospective facilitator–doubt the directive then it’s nonsensical to ask for a group agreement on it. You can read an article I wrote that &lt;a href=&quot;https://teotti.com/analyze-kerth-prime-directive/&quot;&gt;dissects the prime directive&lt;/a&gt; and better understand its roots. There is also a retrospective activity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://teotti.com/challenge-agile-retrospectives-prime-directive/&quot;&gt;challenge the retrospective&lt;/a&gt; prime directive with the group so instead of just a verbal yes you’d have a conversation about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime directive is similar to bounded rationality and when embraced allows the group to shift from looking for a culprit to collaboratively looking at the context and generate insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-retrospective-purpose&quot;&gt;The retrospective purpose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If people don’t know why they’re in a retrospective and what they will get out of it they will be disengaged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt your retro is more like a happy hour then a reflection? Very often teams go through the motions and always run retrospective to “reflect on what could be improved from the last iteration”. For a 3 or 4 people team and smaller challenges that could work for a little while but I’ve seen that purpose lead to premature convergence. I’ve seen retros where people would discuss for the same amount of time items like “someone left a glass on the desk and there is now mold in it” and “we should refactor the reservation class based on the application’s bounded contexts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think spending 2 minutes discussing an item is not reflection. The problem I see is that people only share information during retrospective so you end up with a lot of those smaller items. I call whack-a-mole retrospective when the team generates lots of mad/sad/glad items and try to fix all the sad with rushed action items. The outcomes I’ve seen are too many action items–carrying over from one iteration to the next–and people never getting to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least a couple of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agree-on-a-real-time-agenda&quot;&gt;Agree on a real time agenda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if the group is ok to try a retrospective with a real time agenda (aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/en/?id=51&quot;&gt;lean coffee&lt;/a&gt;). This helps because once the topics are listed the group can create clusters with a silent mapping activity, run a poll to prioritise what to talk about first. In this format the group decides if they want to keep talking about a topic of move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical piece–where the facilitator or an action item taker can help–is to acknowledge when a discussion ie. “we should refactor the reservation class based on the application’s bounded contexts” &lt;strong&gt;will not fit in the allocated timebox and agree to have a separate meeting dedicated to that topic&lt;/strong&gt;. You must be clear about the purpose of the followup meeting. Is it to share information? Advance the thinking? Provide input? Make decisions? Improve communication? These goals are from Sam Kaner’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Facilitators-Participatory-Decision-Making-Jossey-bass-Management/dp/1118404955&quot;&gt;Facilitator’s guide to participatory decision making&lt;/a&gt;” another great resource about having clear meeting is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Where-Action-Meetings-Break-Organization/dp/1732205205&quot;&gt;Where the action is&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-a-retrospective-topic&quot;&gt;Pick a retrospective topic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be to focus the retrospective on a topic agreed with the team before the meeting–but that assume there was some preparation. When we focus the retrospective someone in the group might still want to talk about off-topic items. If people feel strongly about sharing something with the group let them do it. I think a better strategy is to run daily 10 minutes retrospectives–for teams of 4 or 5–so the team has space to share information during the week and focus on overarching issues during the iteration retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparedness&quot;&gt;Preparedness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective is a meeting and to run a good meeting you need a clear purpose and some preparation.  Your plan might not survive contact with the team–and their evershifting context–so it’s ok to improvise at that point. &lt;strong&gt;The facilitator should not go in and improvise activities by default or come in unprepared&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in to retrospective without a clue of what happened during the iteration should be an exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In small (5/6 people teams) I like to prevent that by taking one-on-one time with the group before retrospective to see what’s on their mind and prepare a retrospective plan that fits where they are at this time. For larger teams you can collect information with the help of co-facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once was in a retrospective where the facilitator was trying to explain Jean Tabaka’s Sailboat activity while reading it on the phone. The group was pretty confused. When I pick up a new activity I write down a little script to explain the activity purpose and what the individuals are expected  to do. If it involves drawing I practice it beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think too often people focus on the retrospective activity rather than on the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-retrospective-framework-instead-of-activities&quot;&gt;Know your retrospective framework instead of activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A framework gives structure to your retrospective and a clear start and end. I base my retrospectives plans on Derby/Larsen’s 5 steps framework and I pick activities that fit the group’s journey. I’ll briefly describe the 5 steps and you can look up other options like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucidmeetings.com/glossary/orid&quot;&gt;ORID&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icacan.org/&quot;&gt;The institute of cultural affairs&lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsdinstitute.org/resources/adaptive-action.html&quot;&gt;Adaptive Action&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsdinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Human system dynamics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the stage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;: the group understands the goal of the retrospective, the room has psychological safety, roles are assigned, team norms acknowledged&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather data&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;: ensures the group is on the same page about what happened about the topic we’re focused on or the timespawn we’re looking at. The outcome should be a snapshot of all perspectives about what happened and hopefully mutual understanding. If the group doesn’t reach mutual understanding I’d spend more time until you get there. Reading “Facilitator’s guide to participatory decision-making” can give strategies to bring a group to mutual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate insights&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;: the group finds focus on a topic with affinity mapping, polling, prioritization to allow the team to go past the immediate solutioning and have a deeper conversation about no more than 1/2 topics. The outcome should be a set of ideas to formalise into an experiment for change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide what to do&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;: the group comes up with a specific, measurable and time bound experiment (aka action item) or acknowledging if the topic is too broad and the time left during retrospective is not sufficient to come up with a detailed plan. If so schedule a followup meeting with its purpose and its desired outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close out&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;: the group acknowledges what was achieved in the meeting and is clear about next steps and responsibilities. Now is a good time to end on a high note with a round of &lt;a href=&quot;https://retromat.org/en/?id=15&quot;&gt;appreciation&lt;/a&gt;. To speed up time in larger groups you can try having folks share appreciations via post-it notes or Jurgen Appelo’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://management30.com/practice/kudo-cards/&quot;&gt;Kudos cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to run a quick retro on your retrospective, I use a +ΔROTI. ROTI came from Esther Derby and it’s a Return Of Time Invested activity where you collect between 0 to 4 how well spent the time was. I ask the group to write the number on a post it note, and add a short sentence next to a Δ sign for the one improvement that would have made their ROTI go up by 1, and a short sentence next to a + for something they liked about today’s retro
    - 0: complete waste of time, I learned nothing
    - 1: mostly a waste of time but I learned one thing
    - 2: broke even, satisfactory retrospective
    - 3: better then an average, I learned quite a few things
    - 4: awesome, best retrospective of my life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to learn more about the framework read Derby/Larsen’s book about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649&quot;&gt;“Agile Retrospectives”&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to learn the origin of the 5 steps framework you can listen to my interview with Diana Larsen on my Retrospective facilitation podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://thisisretrospectivefacilitation.com/episodes/the-five-steps-retrospective-framework&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaboration&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the facilitator you’re not alone. If the retrospective is in a safe environment and there is a purpose and you are prepared the group should be there to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to juggle time keeping, note taking and action item collection while facilitating you can ask for volunteers for those tasks! That way there is a shared ownership of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are the facilitator but also a team member–scrum master/product manager/lead/whatever–you have a hard job to keep your biases under control. I know I do as the team product manager–and previously principal engineer–I had very strong opinions on team topics we talked in retrospective I was facilitating. When I had something that I felt was critical for the group to hear I would say: “I am taking my facilitator hat off and as a PM I think…”. I usually try to keep it to a brief sentence to give more colour and then go back to my facilitator role unless more context is required. It might be good to have a backup facilitator if you feel your stakes are too high and you might not be an impartial facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can ensure there is collaboration by having silent activities. For example instead of having an open discussion–where introverts and less loud people would be having a harder time contributing–use an activity like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/&quot;&gt;1-2-4-all&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose, having individuals brainstorm–ideas or topic–alone, then in pairs, then 4 then with the whole group. There are a multitude of activities out there, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberatingstructures.com&quot;&gt;Liberating Structures&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://retromat.org&quot;&gt;Retromat&lt;/a&gt; are good repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the facilitator skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage full participation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promote mutual understanding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foster inclusive solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate shared responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a retrospective to become more effective your organization and team should foster &lt;strong&gt;psychological safety&lt;/strong&gt;, as the facilitator try to &lt;strong&gt;prepare&lt;/strong&gt; and define a clear retrospective &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure the group stays engaged and takes on targeted action items. Ultimately a retrospective requires &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; and the facilitator (you?) is there to make sure the ride goes smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to tackle organizational issues remember the team is part of a system. Look up Larsen/Shore’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilefluency.org&quot;&gt;agile fluency&lt;/a&gt; maturity model and Snowden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitive-edge.com/videos/cynefin-framework-introduction/&quot;&gt;Cynefin&lt;/a&gt; sense making framework for seeing issues and contexts from different lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Event storming one year later</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About 15 months ago I participated in an Event Storm masterclass in Milan with Alberto Brandolini. This post assumes you already know what event storm is and you’re interested in reading about usecases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start with a foundamental premise. What I like of event storm is how collaborative it is. &lt;strong&gt;When I see a facilitator doing all the work in an event storm it’s really hard for me to be politically correct and say “you’re doing it differently” what I wanna say is “you’re doing it wrong”.&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted there might be scenarios where the facilitator wants to speed trough the process but the power I’ve seen in event storm is when the group discovers and communicates to create a shared picture. If a facilitator is the only one adding information then event storm isn’t much different then a service blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 15 months I’ve run multiple event storms here’s a few use cases with pro and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-training&quot;&gt;Internal training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a 2 hours internal training event storm to “learn how my company works while practicing event storm”. As Alberto did in the masterclass I kept instructions at a minimum and threw all the participant in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People: 15 (from 5 divisions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pro: people got to learn more about other parts of the company. Easy to contribute domain events without needing to setup role-play.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Con: the large org (3K ppl) meant there was a lot of details. See photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-kickoff--future-state&quot;&gt;Project kickoff + future state&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a project kickoff I run a 4 hours session with a small company ~10 people to walk us trough their current processes. As the project went on we used event storm to visualise the future state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People: 3 (CEO, Director of Underwriting, Director of Sales) ~3h&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pro: All client folks aligned on where the hotspots are. Contractors ramped up pretty fast on the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Con: CEO wanted to fix everything. It took some tries to start in one spot. We didn’t have CEO or Sales director for Future state exercise which created misunderstandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoping-of-work&quot;&gt;Scoping of work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A client scoping to understand their current process and their priorities for a subsystem to add to their processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People: ~6 on their side (3 divisions) ~2h&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pro: gave contractors a good return on time invested to create a next steps proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Con: unclear what systems/events were there and which ones were future state. For mitigation, I asked to mark the future state with a black dot on the top right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sharing-domain-expertise-to-rampup-devs&quot;&gt;Sharing domain expertise to rampup devs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A client that worked in a domain that contractors were not familiar in–contractual bonding–shared the business flow.
* People: ~10 client + contractors ~2h
* Pro: the two domaine experts shared information and folks with partial knowledge &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see event storm as a tool to design for emergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its final result is a snapshot in time and context. It’s a snapshot of the current understanding of the system or subsystem we’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did take photos of the outcome to document the process but I kept reminding everyone present we shouldn’t consider the outcome as a golden document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be able to recreate it. Probably not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience it’s been a useful tool to allow groups to gain a shared understanding on a system and align on what to takle first.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Big picture event storming. My notes from the masterclass.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of what I learned–circa 15 months ago–about big picture event storming during a two day workshop with Alberto Brandolini creator of Event Storming. I’ll skip the domain modelling usecase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how useful this is for anyone else, I wrote a blog post about my experience using this tecnique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The objective of big picture event storming is finding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto describes three context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organization reboot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;startup kickoff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project kickoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out where the business is today. If the project kickoff is about something in the wrong spot that’s valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Event storming can be used to get a picture of what a company does. Specifically it outlines &lt;strong&gt;what people want to do&lt;/strong&gt; vs. &lt;strong&gt;what the process mandates them to do&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a map. A snapshot of the current situation. Expect all the dysfunction to be visible. Then as a group you can decide to focus on what’s the top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scenarios&quot;&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe your process is doing a great job. Then you don’t need investigation. You’d end up telling a story that is just working.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start-up that doesn’t have any existing infrastructure you can use event storming to scope where they want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an enterprise with legacy systems you can use event storming to outline their current &lt;strong&gt;understanding&lt;/strong&gt;, the way they think their company works, and according to Alberto more often then not there is a feeling of awe when he runs those sessions. People realized what other division do. This session helps collecting understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“As a facilitator you want to hear/see different voices”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rule-number-one&quot;&gt;Rule number one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The number one rule is to get the right people in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Agile Retrospective background where I try to gage the team feelings and interactions before the meeting the first question I had was “do you chat with the individuals before the event storming session?”. The answer was no, &lt;strong&gt;because chatting one by one wouldn’t be as effective as hearing those conversations for the first time when the whole group is in the room&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question I asked was &lt;em&gt;how do you make sure it’s the right people?&lt;/em&gt; You will find out at the end of the session. If the meeting constantly mention James and he’s not in the room perhaps we need him after all. Based on how much influence you have in the company you might not start with the right people in the room but as you show how effective the methodology is you will gain more sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anti-patterns&quot;&gt;Anti-patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ask questions first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agree upfront&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the committee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;start from the beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patterns&quot;&gt;Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ice-breaker (someone will eventually put the first domain event… just wait for it… or do it yourself)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make a mess&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;start from the center&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one person one marker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inifinite buffet (aka make sure space doesn’t limit the process)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;just do it (I never asked to do it right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The goal for an event storming facilitator is to remove impediments. Not enforcing rules or agendas.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaos first then timeline. You start asking individuals to add &lt;strong&gt;domain events&lt;/strong&gt; on orange sticky notes. Don’t worry too much about the order &lt;em&gt;just do it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need chaos to challenge the perception people have of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you made a mess it’s time to start sorting. This is a good time to take care of duplicates. There are different strategies to sort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pivotal events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;phases (roles &amp;amp; responsabilities)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;temporal milestones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at pivotal events identify &lt;strong&gt;domain event&lt;/strong&gt; that are critical to your business. One easy way is to identify which events are listening for the &lt;strong&gt;pivotal event&lt;/strong&gt; to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hotspots--opportunities&quot;&gt;Hotspots + opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you create this map you can start asking where are the problems? As an event storming facilitator you are entitiled to ask stupid questions. That’s your superpower! Look at the audience to check if the conversation is relevant to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to balance out bad with good. Ask the group to add green stickys for opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let hotspots be a voice for concerns. Should you focus on a corner case? Look at the rest of the audience, is it a problem for the group? If not move on. Alberto describes how looking at the audience reaction to discovery can lead to interesting next steps. He describes how sometimes individuals are disengaged bored of hearing the same thing again and again… and other times they lean forward and discovered something new about their organization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people--systems&quot;&gt;People / systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you add external systems your business relies on. This could be software we own or a SAS. Let system definition be fuzzy. Just make things visible. No wordsmithing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A system is “whatever you can put the blame on”.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualize everything. Start being agressive not on the problem but on the message. Make everything visible so we can see the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto mentions how making hypothesis in a startup environment is ok. But in a corporate environment a domain expert looking up and scratching beard/head is a sign that this guy is not the real domain expert. Just a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto mentions the “karaoke singer” where an individual overtake the stage. He suggests to talk with someone that didn’t go live during the workshop. Probably later after the workday ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto mentions how event storming can’t solve people problems. He was in a sessions where two individuals wouldn’t establish eye contact… or even talk to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alberto says he’s got a default plan but it can be hijacked if the group wants to.&lt;/strong&gt; What to dig on is up to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A suggestion Alberto gave was do not ask permission to run event storming. &lt;strong&gt;Say you will run a modelling process.&lt;/strong&gt; Events grooming / gathering to get a big picture of the business. In some environments this might be easier then getting buy-in for a “new technique”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business people will talk about requirements not edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;telling-the-story---enterpise-wise-defrag&quot;&gt;Telling the story - Enterpise wise defrag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time for the facilitator to slowly revisit the flow. Accelerate or jump to section. Set the the tone and have people contradicting you. Ask the audience “please tell your version of the story”. As the facilitator you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to invite someone in the group to be the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator is a glue between words and the visible model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;telling-the-story-backwards---reverse-narrative&quot;&gt;Telling the story backwards - Reverse narrative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps making the story more consistent. The facilitator usually leads this. Sometimes it allows to discover new areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this session we’re not looking for completeness. If everybody is forgetting about something maybe it’s not important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an event storming session there should be no invisible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrow-voting&quot;&gt;Arrow voting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group must vote and decide what has higher priority. Explore with no scope limitation but then narrow down to one item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t use arrow voting with the wrong people in the room.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your perception of the problem is completely flawed if everybody says the problem is what you don’t expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next&quot;&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime people just acknowledge problems and opportunities but decide to skip the rollercoaster ride. You want to go on the rollercoaster and have some fun working on this issues! Skipping the ride, or pretending that’s not a problem would be the company’s loss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should you do if someone says “oh we know that’s bad” and doesn’t wanna act. What I learned is it depends. Who’s the sponsor? What’s the goal?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of day 1 you should have priorities and hotspots / opportunities. In the morning of day 2 look for something actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the workshop you might get impromptu conversations. Go in early the following day. They might adjust the timeline the morning after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selection-bias&quot;&gt;Selection bias&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an imbalance–selection bias–on the group and developers vs business arrow situation then the facilitator should mediate between business and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Can the problem be solved with software? Maybe you’re missing knowledge, expertise, dysfunctional communication patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an event storming session you can determing that the symptom is here but the root causes might be somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an event storming session the team got a little bit wiser then at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outcome--formats&quot;&gt;Outcome &amp;amp; formats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;event-storming-as-a-regular-investment&quot;&gt;Event storming as a regular investment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto runs regular–every 2/3 months–event storming sessions at his company as a way to on-board new team members and to review current process / pain-points. When running it this was you want to ask what’s the best outcome given the time? The point is not to explore everything but rather explore everything enough so that pain points surface. You should design different workshops for different purposes to achieve maximum gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this session you can assess if we can do better then this. If you can we can just go ahead and change it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this write up give more context to folks interested in event storming. For more info Alberto is working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like a quicker read I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://teotti.com/event-storming-one-year-later&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; about my experience with this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remote visual facilitation with iPad pro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this brif post I explain how I do visual facilitation and visual recording with an iPad, Mac Book and Zoom. You can probably use a PC instead of a Mac Book but I haven’t tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipad-screen-sharing&quot;&gt;iPad screen sharing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the iPad with a USB cable to the Mac Book pro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you accept whatever prompt about trusting computer etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open quicktime and select “New Movie Recording”, choose iPad from the drop down. If you don’t see iPad listed the connection failed and you’ll have to truble shoot that first. In my experience unplugging and re-connecting the USB cable helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you are “seeing” what’s on the iPad from your Mac Book. Open your visual facilitation app of choice and confirm its as responsive as you would like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Zoom to screen share with remote participants. If you know of other tools that allow for multiple screen sharing leave  a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open the Zoom settings and update to use dual monitors &lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/remote-visual-facilitation-with-ipad-pro/step1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you start your meeting ensure your meeting sharing option is set to the correct option: “Multiple participant can share simultaneously” &lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/remote-visual-facilitation-with-ipad-pro/step2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At this point multiple participants can share their screen, here I am using it with two folks &lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/remote-visual-facilitation-with-ipad-pro/hero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution is working for me today when I do visual recording–aka scribing–and lead remote visual facilitation for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside in the latter is participants can’t interact with your whiteboard. I use an interactive online tool–like Miro aka RealTimeBoard–to promote and allow participation, potentially you could export the note to your online board when you need to be more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave us a comment if you have a similar strategy and different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Challenge Kerth&#39;s prime directive when you set the stage of your retro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post assumes you know what a retrospective is and focuses on an activity to set the stage challenging what Kert’s prime directive means to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an 80% muted–no talking–activity to use at the start of your retro. It should last between 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the facilitator asks the group for a verbal yes to agree with Kerth’s prime directive. Most people can see its value but sometime you get a “&lt;em&gt;yeaahh sure I agree… they did the best job they could&lt;/em&gt;” but what that person really thinks is “&lt;strong&gt;they did a really stinky job&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime people think that about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-use-the-activity&quot;&gt;When to use the activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d use this activity on groups new to Kerth’s prime directive or groups where an individual dismissed the directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to give time to the group to better understand the meaning of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using this activity &lt;a href=&quot;/analyze-kerth-prime-directive/&quot;&gt;make sure you fully understand the directive yourself&lt;/a&gt; or it will be challenging to deal with questions from your group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;activity-introduction&quot;&gt;Activity introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator reads the prime directive and explains that by accepting it the group will make retrospective a more constructive and effective environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Norm Kerth prime directive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of asking the group for the directive acceptance with a verbal yes tell them we will spend a few minutes questioning the directive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the group a minute or two to remember an episode in their previous job where they believe the prime directive could not be applied. Read the directive highlighting the &lt;strong&gt;givens&lt;/strong&gt; portion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;given what was known at the time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;given his or her skills and abilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;given the resources available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;given the situation at hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After&lt;/strong&gt; the two minutes of thinking back–or less–ask them to summarize the episode on a post-it note. If people believe in the directive you can ask to summarize an episode where the directive was applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done writing ask them to reflect on the &lt;strong&gt;factors&lt;/strong&gt; that might have affected that episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what was known at the time of the episode/incident&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what were that person’s–or group–skills and abilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what resources–time, team size, bandwidth–were available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what was the situation at hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting about these factors will help us gain a better understanding of the events we look during retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;activity-debriefing&quot;&gt;Activity debriefing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on how these factors impacted the job done ask if they still think the best job wasn’t done given these &lt;strong&gt;factors&lt;/strong&gt; or if perhaps they don’t know how to answer about these &lt;strong&gt;factors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to ask each participants if they accept the prime directive for today’s retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skeptics-in-the-group&quot;&gt;Skeptics in the group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind the group that it’s ok to still think the directive doesn’t apply to their episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask if they are ok sharing the episode with the group and try to understand the factors. Also acknowledge that sometimes there are extreme situations where individuals might purposely sabotaging projects and use an unprofessional conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask them if they are ok &lt;strong&gt;putting aside their biases and accept the directive for the duration of today’s retrospective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they accept thank them. If they still refuse–even just for today’s retro–there must be a deeper issue that needs to be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s an individual I’d say continue the retrospective and keep an eye on his/her behavior and follow-up one-on-one afterwards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the majority of the group feels that way it’s better to call the retrospective off and investigate further on the root cause of that tension.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives are the most important part of an iteration and changing their format is imperative to keep people engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people understand Kerth’s prime directive printing it out and reminding people about it is usually enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are new to Kerth’s prime directive it’s good to explain it and challenge it instead of getting a–often disengaged–verbal yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before trying this activity &lt;a href=&quot;/analyze-kerth-prime-directive/&quot;&gt;make sure you fully understand the directive&lt;/a&gt; there is another great post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/retrospective-prime-directive&quot;&gt;questioning the directive&lt;/a&gt; with input from though leaders in the retrospective community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analyze Kerth prime directive</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post assumes you know what a retrospective is and focuses on Kerth’s prime directive to ensure the facilitator can answer common challenges around the directive and confidently explain it to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks ago I gave a public presentation about retrospectives and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hatxoP-MU0&amp;amp;t=7m00s&quot;&gt;after introducing Kerth’s directive&lt;/a&gt; a person in the audience shouted to me “that is a lie!”. Btw that link is the same presentation but different audience so no shouting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create a constructive session Kerth’s prime directive is usually read–and agreed upon–at the beginning of a retrospective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to ask what in the directive was bothering that person but he mostly vented how some people can only do a poor job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive sends a strong message that is often misunderstood. I might have not explained it very well so I decided to write down my thoughts in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dissecting-the-directive&quot;&gt;Dissecting the directive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the prime directive states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which leads to misunderstandings &lt;strong&gt;without reflecting on the second part of the directive&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime directive doesn’t pardon negligent acts–more on this point later–it gently reminds us that there are &lt;strong&gt;factors&lt;/strong&gt; to provide context on why &lt;strong&gt;the best job that someone did&lt;/strong&gt; might look so poor in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accepting the directive means we are willing to focus the retrospective on those factors instead of playing a quick and easy blame game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;given-what-was-known-at-the-time&quot;&gt;Given what was known at the time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course today–&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the event happened–we probably already know more then back then or maybe decisions were made based on lack of context! &lt;strong&gt;“Was the new testing URL shared with all developers with enough time? Even the new hires from last week?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;given-his-or-her-skills-and-abilities&quot;&gt;Given his or her skills and abilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the refactor triggered a runtime error–crashing the production app–because the person joined last week and had no prior experience with the backend language or didn’t know how to run our test framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;given-the-resources-available&quot;&gt;Given the resources available&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the developer was &lt;strong&gt;rushed to deploy the change in 30 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; before the all-hands status meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;given-the-situation-at-hand&quot;&gt;Given the situation at hand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that &lt;strong&gt;part of changed code was a knowledge silo owned by another developer that quit the day before&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-must-be-someones-fault&quot;&gt;It must be someone’s fault&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a developer brings a production API down was that the best job he could do? He’s probably aware of his mistake and ready to take the blame. But what good does finding a culprit bring us if we don’t learn the circumstances and look for a root cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the best job he could do &lt;strong&gt;given what he knew at that time&lt;/strong&gt; if for example he didn’t have any context on what API he was about to turn off! &lt;strong&gt;Perhaps no one was awake to tell him that deployxyz.myapp.com was switched to be the production API URL during this morning 4am hotfix&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promoting-incompetence&quot;&gt;Promoting incompetence?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime directive doesn’t mean there isn’t accountability. It simply tells us to stop looking for blame and accept that there are factors we need to gather a fuller picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If when you have the full picture some actions are proven to be grave work misconducts they should be addressed by HR outside of a retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first time Kerth’s prime directive is introduced to a team it deserves to be dissected, questioned and explained rather then just read and asked for agreement. If you don’t you risk people resenting it because they will accept it without fully understanding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this article will help retrospective facilitators to better understand Kerth’s prime directive and engage in constructive conversations with their group. I am writing a post about an activity to set the stage to challenge the prime directive to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the prime directive a lie? I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a philosophical mind trick? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it help starting retrospectives in a positive environment and focus on learning instead of playing the blame game? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accept it. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measure success of your agile retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Retrospectives should be a core practice for any team but &lt;strong&gt;you must have a way to measure their success and team engagement otherwise they can become just another meeting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retrospective should generate a quantitatively measurable experiment/action item and the team engagement metrics will generate qualitative measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll explain why they’re both critical to retrospective success. Folks that have been in retrospectives and wondered “what’s the point of this meeting?” should get a better understanding of their purpose and facilitators/scrum masters will learn when/how to measure retrospective engagement and success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You retrospective must be a safe environment or people won’t speak their mind&lt;/strong&gt;. I gave a 20 minutes talk at the Sydney Pivotal office about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hatxoP-MU0&quot;&gt;How to measure retrospective success&lt;/a&gt; and I share ideas to check your retrospective safety and how to improve it. If you’re interested in retrospectives I gave a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pw-p6DzvFQ&quot;&gt;switching retrospective formats&lt;/a&gt; loosely based on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://teotti.com/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-run-retrospectives&quot;&gt;Why we run retrospectives?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right mindset for a retrospective requires the team to understand and agree that today &lt;strong&gt;we know more then we did last week&lt;/strong&gt;. I think Kerth’s prime directive captures that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the agile manifesto captures the spirit of why we run retrospectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to run retrospectives &lt;strong&gt;at regular intervals&lt;/strong&gt; because doing it “when we need it” is like seeking urgent dental care after you pop a decade old filling–and half your tooth–instead of preventing that with regular checkups. Regular intervals will allow you to measure how the team feel about retrospective–more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want the team to &lt;strong&gt;reflect on how to become more effective&lt;/strong&gt; because acting on individual issues might fix the symptoms instead of the root cause. Reflect on hard data and feelings then look for patterns, generate insights. Take time to reflect and don’t rush to find a solution for each item that comes up like if you were playing a whack a mole game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want the team to commit to &lt;strong&gt;tune and adjust its behavior&lt;/strong&gt; with an agreed and quantitatively measurable experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-your-retrospective-success&quot;&gt;Measure your retrospective success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to use the S.M.A.R.T. experiment–SMART is a simple acronym to remind us to come up with an experiment that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specific&quot;&gt;Specific:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should pair program more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; isn’t very specific. Instead use: &lt;strong&gt;Pair program everyday 4 hours per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measurable&quot;&gt;Measurable:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can measure how many times you &lt;strong&gt;Pair program 4 hours per day&lt;/strong&gt;. You should also measure hard data like velocity, delivered stories, bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This measurement should be quantitative and related to how effective your team is. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;achievable&quot;&gt;Achievable:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an experiment that generate consensus with the team. It won’t be a good idea to come up with &lt;strong&gt;Pair program everyday 8 hours per day&lt;/strong&gt; when you know people are skeptic about it. Find a more suitable experiment, maybe &lt;strong&gt;Pair program 2 days per week&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an experiment that makes the team step out of their comfort zone without attempting to fix things clearly out of reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevant&quot;&gt;Relevant:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to pair program? Because someone told you so? Not very relevant or meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps someone called out that &lt;em&gt;Jack was sick 4 days and we could not work on the iOS react native UI components&lt;/em&gt; and also &lt;em&gt;designers are not available to clarify how user interface should work&lt;/em&gt; so you might &lt;strong&gt;want to break knowledge silos that block team progress&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s one great use of pair programming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timebound&quot;&gt;Timebound:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not use an open ended experiment. Make sure there is an end to it like &lt;strong&gt;we will try pair programming for 2 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; and then decide to continue or adjust the experiment. Having a timebound experiment should create common ground between optimists and skeptics and facilitate trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our measurable SMART experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to break knowledge silos that often block our team progress. In order to do that developers will pair program 4 hours a day for the next 2 weeks. Designers will pair program 1hour a day with developers to clarify and learn app internal behavior We will keep track of how many times we do that on the pair programming sheet on our shared workspace. In 2 weeks we will review this experiment and decide if we want to continue or adjust it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the article explaining how to measure your retrospective success to address the quantitative measurement first but the experiment is formulated in the middle of the retrospective. When you start your retrospective you should get a qualitative measurement on team engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-team-engagement-esvp&quot;&gt;Measure team engagement (ESVP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/measure-success-of-your-agile-retrospective/esvp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you start retrospective&lt;/strong&gt; you should spend 5/10 minutes measuring the team engagement. Depending on how safe it is you can make it anonymous or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to do that using an activity–from Derby and Larsen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;–called ESVP. You ask the team which role between &lt;strong&gt;Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, Prisoner&lt;/strong&gt; represents best how they feel about today’s retrospective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explorers&quot;&gt;Explorers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to make the most out of today’s retrospective. Learn everything they can about the iteration/project, leave no stone unturned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shoppers&quot;&gt;Shoppers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re happy to be part of the retrospective and want to actively look for something to put in their cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vacationers&quot;&gt;Vacationers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re not interested in retrospective but they rather be in it then doing actual work at their desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prisoners&quot;&gt;Prisoners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve been forced to sit in this meeting but don’t see a point in it and won’t be actively participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting these at regular intervals will allow you to learn when the team is shifting from engaged to disengaged and adjust your retrospective accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also allow you to celebrate when the team shifts the other way around! Learn what you’re doing well and try do more of it or &lt;strong&gt;share it with other teams in your organization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/measure-success-of-your-agile-retrospective/esvp_graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;print the weekly figures on a graph on your shared space&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-the-return-of-time-invested-roti&quot;&gt;Measure the return of time invested (ROTI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you finish retrospective&lt;/strong&gt; you should spend 5/10 minutes measuring how well we spent the allocated time. I usually ask the team how was the return of time invested for this meeting between 0 and 4 where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excellent&quot;&gt;4: Excellent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means this meeting was invaluable and if you skipped it you would have missed some key piece of information. You’re very glad you were in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;above-average&quot;&gt;3: Above average&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting was a good use of your time you learned new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;average&quot;&gt;2: Average&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting gave you enough to justify your presence for the time spent on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;below-average&quot;&gt;1: Below average&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gained some value but it was mostly a waste of time. This meeting was below average and wasn’t worth 100% of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;useless&quot;&gt;0: Useless&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting was a waste of time. You gained nothing and wished you skipped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they choose a number ask one suggestion/idea to improve by one point. The retrospective is coming to an end so tell the team we won’t engage in long discussions about those ideas but rather collect them and review them to adjust our next retro. Timebox each person to 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/measure-success-of-your-agile-retrospective/roti_graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;print the weekly figures on a graph on your shared space&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making your team more effective doesn’t need to tackle huge issues all the time. What is critical is to measure and review the experiment progress at regular intervals so the team can trust retrospective to be a meaningful tool to adjust their process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a constant eye on how the team feels about retro because failing to do so might generate a room full of disengaged prisoners that believe they’re wasting their time making your experiment not achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to try some of the suggested strategies? Do you already measure your retrospectives? What challenges do you face?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time to change your agile retrospective format?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article–targeted to retrospective facilitators–I describe my experience going from a simple retrospective format to a more structured one following Derby and Larsen’s book on Agile Retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the first format working for teams of 2/3 developers new to retrospectives but it was ineffective for larger teams on challenging projects–it ended up feeling like a status update meeting–so I introduced to the second format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start by describing what I call a classic retrospective and the biggest risk I encountered with it. Then I describe the structured retrospective I introduced. Finally some tradeoffs of the structured retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a 15 minutes talk about this subject at Pivotal Labs in Los Angeles, you can watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pw-p6DzvFQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested I wrote a blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://teotti.com/measure-success-of-your-agile-retrospective/&quot;&gt;measuring retrospective success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is about retrospective for co-located teams&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-classic-retrospective&quot;&gt;The classic retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re practicing a retrospective it’s very likely that this is the format you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole team gets in a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a random person is picked as the facilitator to ensure the conversations are kept on track and timeboxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the whole group starts adding last iteration events to a whiteboard–or an electronic equivalent–with three columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;glad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;representing the feeling that the event triggered &lt;strong&gt;for that person&lt;/strong&gt;. Multiple variations of this exists–ie. start, stop, continue–but the root activity stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the team is done adding items the facilitator kicks off the retrospective by reviewing the outcome of the last retrospective and then starting timeboxed discussions about each event on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator is also asking if there is any “action item” to make that event better. In this retrospective format an action item is often described as an attempt to prevent a negative event from reoccurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime the scrum master act as the facilitator. In my experience is very unlikely that the team will recognize the same person pressing for delivery and deadlines as an unbiased facilitator. The result will be that &lt;strong&gt;the retrospective will feel just like a status update meeting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pro-of-this-retro&quot;&gt;Pro of this retro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s really simple to explain to people new to retrospectives because the format is always the same&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everybody’s event is very likely to be–perhaps briefly–discussed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The facilitator can be a random team member and doesn’t need any special training (not quite true but more on this …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons-of-this-retro&quot;&gt;Cons of this retro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;randomly picked facilitator&lt;/strong&gt; might not have the skills,empathy or willingness to manage arguments. In extreme cases I’ve seen that person &lt;strong&gt;hijack the retrospective making it about a subject of his/her interest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the same format for months &lt;strong&gt;won’t keep people’s brain engaged&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s the responsibility of a diligent facilitator to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mad, sad, glad–or whatever names you use–is an effective way to collect events but &lt;strong&gt;can’t generate insight of the overarching problems that generates them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biggest-risk-is&quot;&gt;The biggest risk is…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focusing on each event and missing an opportunity to see the overarching root cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example based on a real project I was on: a sad face on “slow deployment” and someone starts talking about &lt;em&gt;“how deployments take over a long time and that’s really slow yada yada yada”&lt;/em&gt; so someone comes up with an &lt;strong&gt;“action item”&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;“investigate deployment speed”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a meh item is &lt;em&gt;“integration with the BAM API is unreliable”&lt;/em&gt; and someone talks about &lt;em&gt;“how 3 out of 5 times BAM is down”&lt;/em&gt; and so someone comes with another &lt;strong&gt;“action item”&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;“use circuit breaker pattern to tackle BAM unavailability”&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These “action items” seem adequate solutions to each problem but by attempting to individually fix them we obfuscate a possible overarching issue and might miss the root cause that would affect them both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example the overarching problem–unveiled by the structured retrospective I’ll introduce next–was miscommunication with the BAM team which was also sharing the responsibility of dev-ops deployments. Later in the article I’ll describe the experiment we attempted to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-the-alternative&quot;&gt;So what’s the alternative?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick fix would be introducing pattern matching. After the board is filled up the whole team works towards grouping the events. But what about the multiple action items? And the rotating facilitator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: it’s critical for the facilitator to be skilled or willing to learn and experiment. &lt;strong&gt;Facilitation is a very hard job and it’s too often dismissed&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideally the facilitator is external to the team so it doesn’t have a stake in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you tried to borrow a facilitator from another team?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator should try a structured retrospective. For the sake of this article’s clarity I use the word structured to distinguish it from the mad,sad,glad + action item that I’ll call “classic retrospective”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A structured retrospective is divided in 5 parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting the stage (5 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gather data (20 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generate insight (15 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plan an experiment (10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;close up (10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I divided the activities so the retrospective would last 60 minutes. I suggest you schedule it for 75 minutes for padding between activities. If you have iterations longer then one week you might need more time. It’s very unlikely that you can achieve an effective retrospective in less then one hour I used a visual timer so the group can see how much time is left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/timetimer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major differences from the “classic retrospective” is the &lt;strong&gt;plan an experiment&lt;/strong&gt; part focused on one experiment rather then a series of “action items”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People accustomed to the classic version want to focus the retrospective on their topic so explain that that might not happen and that instead the team will focus on what has higher priority for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This might upset someone&lt;/strong&gt; using retrospectives to vent their feelings. Make sure that there is still a place for them to do that perhaps before the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the facilitator have you asked your team &lt;strong&gt;what will achieve value for time invested in this retrospective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the facilitator have you asked your team &lt;strong&gt;what have we tried before? what happened? what would you like to happen differently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the retrospective objective is &lt;strong&gt;defined by the team&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-the-stage&quot;&gt;Setting the stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking those two questions is a good way to &lt;em&gt;set the stage&lt;/em&gt; and make sure everybody understands the purpose of the retrospective. One of my favourites exercise is to read &lt;em&gt;Kerth’s prime directive&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ask for a verbal yes from each member. If there are individuals not willing to set aside opinions–at least for the sake of the retrospective–then you have a bigger problem and you should cancel the retrospective. There might be someone in the room that people don’t feel comfortable around or other group dynamics that need investigation. Have one on one conversations with those individuals that didn’t agree with the directive and investigate what their opinion is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retrospective should be a no naming no blaming activity and the prime directive is a strong and meaningful sentence that encapsulates those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;explorer-shopper-vacationer-prisoner&quot;&gt;Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, Prisoner&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/esvp.png&quot; alt=&quot;ESVP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good activity to discover–or track–team interest about the retrospective is ESVP. You will &lt;strong&gt;anonymously&lt;/strong&gt; collect how the participants feel about the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/explorer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the explorer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one end the explorer wanting to leave no stone unturned and enthusiastically learn as much as possible.  At the opposite end the prisoner that was forced in to the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a room full of prisoners you should consider cancel the retrospective. Having occasional prisoners is ok–&lt;strong&gt;make sure you acknoledge their presence and thank them for their patience and participation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not ask who’s the prisoner&lt;/strong&gt; if they feel like speaking up they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one retrospective I facilitated I had some prisoners. I eventually learned–during the closeout step–that the time of the retro was too close to the end of day forcing them to rush catching their train back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure you comunicate to the group how long the retrospective will last and commit to end on time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gather-data&quot;&gt;Gather data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/timeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked the team to collect data during the week on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/rising-continuous-retrospective&quot;&gt;continuous timeline&lt;/a&gt; so during retrospective they could read that and &lt;strong&gt;remember&lt;/strong&gt; what happened during that iteration–add new things if they forgot–ask each other questions and be ready for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s important for the whole team to read and understand what’s on the board.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those events can be color coded at the time of the writing or you can decide to color code during the retrospective. The second option might spark interesting conversations because an event–ie. quick and dirty refactoring–that is sad from the eyes of the author could be a happy for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/timeline-color-coded.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other good pieces of data to show at this point are number of delivered stories/points, number of deployments, bug count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline should collect events–and hard data–for example: “spent 16 hours fixing the dropdown bug” instead of “we don’t deliver fast enough” which is a personal consideration. Personal consideration and feeling are important and they will be discussed in the next step: generate insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suggestion: If you’re keeping the post-its from the weekly continuous timeline for a longer project retrospective I found it useful to timestamp the iteration week to facilitate the creation of the project timeline:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/timestamped-events.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-insight&quot;&gt;Generate insight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have information about what happened on the last iteration the team can start looking for patterns. Ask them to move the events in to groups/topics. As a facilitator make sure the whole team participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/generate-insight.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be halfway trough your restrospective and have a handful of overarching topics. Ask the team to vote on each group so the one with highest count will be the focus of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;it-doesnt-always-work&quot;&gt;It doesn’t always work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the group is large or the team has a lot of friction it might be hard to decide a topic to discuss within the time allocated for retro. In that case is good to prepare a list of topics to generate insight on. I like to ask those to individual team members before the retro.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/team-radar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;team radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During team radar people vote from 0 to 10 how well the team perform on a number of topics. Then the conversation starts and the facilitator add notes as people talk about the reason for their votes. This is a direct way to generate insights on specific areas/topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experiment&quot;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once one ovearching topic has been identified it’s time to formalize a measurable experiment to incorporate in the next iteration. I like to stick it to the timeline so everyone can read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/change-your-agile-retrospective-format/experiment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the experiment to have the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypotesis&lt;/strong&gt;: “a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;: “a procedure undertaken to test a hypothesis”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurement&lt;/strong&gt;: having measurements help determine if the experiment was successful or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hypotesis: Having two BAM API developers pairing–ideally on site–with the team will help speed up deployments and debug BAM problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment: Propose to the BAM team manager to have two devs to work next to the team. If not possible use remote desktop sharing with webcams to see each other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measurement: Count number of times BAM is not operational. How long it takes for BAM to be operational again. How many times BAM developers are pairing on site. How many times BAM developers are pairing remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hypotesis: The team agrees that: 9’oclock is an acceptable standup time and starting standup everyday at the same time regardless of who’s missing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment: Standup starts at 9am everyday with a–weekly–facilitator assigned on the calendar. If the measurement shows low presence reschedule standup at 9.30am. Enrico will create the facilitator calendar for the next 2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measurement: How many times standup starts after 9? How many people are missing the 9’oclock standup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing&quot;&gt;Closing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to finish the retrospective and there are two activities I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is to end on a high note with the &lt;strong&gt;apreciation&lt;/strong&gt; activity. This activity is &lt;strong&gt;only for praises&lt;/strong&gt;.  For example: &lt;strong&gt;I apreciate Linda for her hard work commuting everyday to be onsite.&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;I apreciate David for his honest feedback while discussing code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be akward silence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind everyone to think back the whole iteration and that even small things should be brough out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I facilitate a team where people were offsite and unable to attend the retrospective so I suggested to write the apreciation on a piece of paper and let the product owner delier that once back at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another activity is to get retrospective feedback from the group. I’d start with anonymous feedback. This is a great way to make sure you and the group are on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cons-of-a-structured-retrospective&quot;&gt;Cons of a structured retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told this retrospective format feels like you’re working. It’s true. The facilitator needs to prepare activities and collect data and the group will need to be much more engaged and will feel like they’re working rather then sitting in a status meeting. I think this is good but be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a willing facilitator it’s hard to introduce this retrospective format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In small teams of 2/3 individuals this format is not very effective. I tried and the folks didn’t see an advantage over the classic format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities are made for face to face interactions and are much harder–sometime inadeguate–to run with remote folks. With a remote team try run the structured retrospective when the team meets face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your classic retrospective feels like a status meeting I hope you will switch to a structured one and pick some new activities from this article and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649&quot;&gt;Derby&amp;amp;Larsen book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your experiences and challenges switching from a classic to structured retro in the comments. If you’d rather start a 1:1 conversation feel free to private message me on twitter @agenteo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Concourse pipeline for consumer driven tests with Spring boot and Ruby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article demonstrates how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://concourse.ci&quot;&gt;Concourse&lt;/a&gt; CI pipeline can run consumer driven tests between two cross language apps: a Java Spring Boot web app and a Ruby Sinatra API. The examples use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pact.io&quot;&gt;PACT framework&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm&quot;&gt;jvm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; implementations. This article assumes basic understanding of pact and how it works so if you want to learn more about it visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://pact.io&quot;&gt;http://pact.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PACT has a broker to share contracts across applications but if your applications ecosystem is already in a pipeline contracts tests can be part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of the code is on github&lt;/strong&gt;: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/pact_concourse_pipeline&quot;&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/spring-boot-pact-consumer&quot;&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/ruby-sinatra-pact-provider&quot;&gt;provider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/pact-repository&quot;&gt;pact repository&lt;/a&gt;. To run the example on your machine you’ll need to fork the repos and update the &lt;code&gt;pipeline.yml&lt;/code&gt; with the new URLs. You’ll also have to specify your Github key when setting the pipeline ie. &lt;code&gt;fly --target travel-inc set-pipeline --config pipeline.yml --pipeline travel-offers --var &quot;pact-repository-key=$(cat your_id_rsa)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity I kept the tech stacks simple: the consumer code is a Spring Boot app using static templates, I used hardcoded provider responses for the Ruby API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example I will start from a green pipeline and then commit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/spring-boot-pact-consumer/commit/41f4f51d2aa2344a02813f1af99f4e3fe140bb9c&quot;&gt;consumer change&lt;/a&gt; that will break the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/ruby-sinatra-pact-provider/commit/e1bebbe59387473cc001d6c8228f8c0b96bae0c1&quot;&gt;provider state&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/ruby-sinatra-pact-provider/commit/33f657593c8d54c50794dfbf231b82b185b68c0e&quot;&gt;fixing the provider&lt;/a&gt; the pipeline will go back to green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-about-the-example&quot;&gt;Background about the example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified example adapted from a real live application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web application &lt;strong&gt;Travel Offers&lt;/strong&gt; displays fabulous travel offers fetched from the tedious legacy &lt;strong&gt;SEAL API&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The travel offers is a green field app so everybody on the team is excited about using new technologies and want to make sure the API integration is solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead the SEAL API is the classic app that nobody wants to work on, 5 years old, lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html&quot;&gt;inadvertent tech debt&lt;/a&gt; and a long backlog of bugfixes and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the SEAL API team is asked to add a new endpoint or field by a consumer their approach has been to add all possible fields and then publish a document so the consumer can’t possibly ask for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer driven test is a refreshing and pragmatic strategy to API design that helps comunication but it will fail miserably if there is no support on the SEAL API team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the SEAL API team is willing to test and honor their contract&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pipeline-to-the-help&quot;&gt;Pipeline to the help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://concourse.ci/&quot;&gt;Concourse&lt;/a&gt; is a CI pipeline that helps visualizing the consumer/provider dependency and automating the contract publishing and verification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/concourse-pipeline-for-consumer-driven-tests-with-spring-boot-and-ruby/pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consumer-driven-change&quot;&gt;Consumer driven change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipeline has a &lt;strong&gt;travel-offers-webapp-consumer-tests&lt;/strong&gt; job that tests the travel offers consumer app interaction with the API provider SEAL API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/spring-boot-pact-consumer/commit/41f4f51d2aa2344a02813f1af99f4e3fe140bb9c&quot;&gt;consumer change&lt;/a&gt; to add a &lt;code&gt;members_price&lt;/code&gt; on the provider. The pipeline picks up that change and runs the consumer tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/concourse-pipeline-for-consumer-driven-tests-with-spring-boot-and-ruby/consumer-pass.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consumer test passes and it generates a JSON PACT (&lt;strong&gt;consumer-driven-api-contracts&lt;/strong&gt;) that the pipeline will upload to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/pact-repository/commit/e6ac9c6e3636747ab3270d18f7a683a323d6541b&quot;&gt;contract git repository&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;There is only one PACT file in this simplified example&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Concourse pipeline will monitor the contract repository. When the new one is published it will run the API provider job (&lt;strong&gt;seal-api-provider-tests&lt;/strong&gt;) and that will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/concourse-pipeline-for-consumer-driven-tests-with-spring-boot-and-ruby/provider-fail.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;provider-update-to-fix-the-pipeline&quot;&gt;Provider update to fix the pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The provider tests are broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://teotti.com/assets/article_images/concourse-pipeline-for-consumer-driven-tests-with-spring-boot-and-ruby/provider-fail.png&quot; alt=&quot;see pact complaining about missing members_price&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On your workstation you will need to fetch the latest contract repositories to get the failing test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agenteo/ruby-sinatra-pact-provider/commit/33f657593c8d54c50794dfbf231b82b185b68c0e&quot;&gt;update the provider&lt;/a&gt; to satisfy the new contract. The pipeline will pickup the provider change and run its tests again returning to a green state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run consumer driven tests in a highly visible Continuous Integration server Concourse can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather then making the entire test suite fail having a consumer driven dedicated pipeline or jobs can increase the understanding of which parts of your ecosystem are broken and allow an incremental approach to TDD and CI.&lt;/p&gt;
