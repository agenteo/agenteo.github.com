A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...

Many folks love themed retrospectives and call them Star Wars retrospective.

I'd advice to make sure your group is somewhat familiar with the franchise BEFORE your decide to go with this approach.

To simplify this article I'll describe the container for this approach:

- Two weeks iterations
- 5/6 people involved
- a Retrospective focused on "what can we make to make our work even more effective"

Here's my take:

Starting with setting the stage, I want the group to connect between themself and with the last iteration.

I'd print Kerth's Directive on a scroll 

I am using a variation of ESVP, using Finn as the storm trooper as somebody that is good but forced in to being a trooper. The reason is to ensure we don't create a us vs them that in the movie is pretty prevalent. Instead a feeling that we're all in this together.

How do you feel about this retrospective?

- Storm Trooper: I don't wanna be here but this is what I've always done.
- Mandalorian: Not sure why we're here. This is an ok break in-between bounty hunting contracts.
- Rebel Alliance member: I am here to work together for a better future for the galaxy!
- Jedi: I want to leave no stone unturned and bring more light to the next iteration.

I am using a variation of the "pick a form of transportation that represents the last iteration for you".

Pick a space ship that describes how the last iteration was for you:

- Death Star
- AT-AT
- Millenium Falcon
- X-Wing

You can explore the differences or simply see them.

I create questions to gather data that connect to the metaphor and to the team. I try to constraint the metaphor, for example focusing on the first and second star wars movie to be more inclusive.

To prevent bounty hunters contract, it's our policy to avoid people's names and rather point to systems and sub-systems. ie. rather then saying: "Luke messed up the database on Monday" we should use "the database got Error Code: 1117. Too many columns after adding one column to its 1699".

- What was turning off our hyperdrive? (frustrating)
- What felt like a trap? Why? (surprise)
- Did we blow up the Death Star? How? (success or fail? How did we get there?)
- Where was the force, bringing the best out of us, in our last iteration? Why?
- Where was the dark side, bringing the worst out of us, in our last iteration? Why?

## Pattern matching

Let's move those cards on to the galaxy map, do we see any patterns? Do they have names?

## What shall we focus on?

How can we make sure our team works more effectively? Do we want this Agile Retrospective outcome to destroy a tie-fighter or defeat the empire?

Let's meditate for 5 minutes and think at ideas that can reduce the negative patterns and radiate the positives.

How can we come up with a thoughtful but actionable plan?

Here we're hinting at the group if we want to focus on simple, complicated or complex issues. I use a Star Wars metaphor for that. See my Cynefin helps retrospectives article for more background on difference between these domains.

If the group replies: "we defeat the Empire by destroying all Tie fighters" you might need to to explore linearity and complexity with them. Short answer is, even if you destroy tie-fighters they'll build more. To free the galaxy, at some point we will need to shift the Empire power.

## Use the FORCE in your next action item!

Make sure the plan follows the: FORCE acronym:

- First step: what is the first step of this plan?
- Observable: what is an observable result that the first step is positively influencing the system? What is an observable result of it negatively influencing the system?
- Responsibility: who is responsible to check on this plan progress?
- Controllable: is the first step something within the team control zone?
- Energy: how much energy do we have for this first step?
