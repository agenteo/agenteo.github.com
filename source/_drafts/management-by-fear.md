One year ago joined a company in New York City as a senior developer -- a few hours after starting I noticed something wrong with my development manager. After working 13 years I started to recognize misbehaviour but I decided to hold on and see where this was going in the same way you reach for a higher cliff when you are top roping or when you try a new recipe -- you go out of your confort zone to learn something valuable the next time you are in the same situation.
