This is a summary of the practices I followed preparing my first public talk at a software conference.

## The motivation

I've been passionate about large Ruby applications maintainability for several years and wanted to share my insight to prevent people making my same mistakes. I wanted to give the audience a memorable story a metaphor for the challenges of unmaintainable code--this story would act as a springboard to a solution--hopefully the one I suggested. 

I wanted to deliver a clear message with a goal that was provoking, audacious but not parallelizing. I expected the audience to disagree, agree or have the desire to find out more about the message. The core idea was: **build large maintainable Ruby applications with the use of Gems/libraries** but it needed some work.

## Getting to the core idea

I based the talk proposal on presentations I gave to local groups but realized in those presentation the core idea was opaque--I was describing a series of events with a level of technical detail that would create a cognitive backlog disengaging the audience.

In October my talk was accepted and I started brainstorming and my bedroom wall became the repository for post-it notes with the flow of the presentation.

It didn't take long to find the core **build maintainable Ruby applications** wasn't just one element but rather the combination of three. Three is the ideal number of items a person can keep in their working memory without being overloaded and it perfectly matched the topic:

>> you can build large maintainable application with Ruby with the use of Gems/libraries, automated tests and team diligence

and then I started working on a generative metaphor to make that idea stick with the audience after the conference.

## The springboard story

I came up with the generative metaphor of piling recipes ingredients in a messy table top as springboard to the core idea but I wasn't sure if it would work so I presented it in November at a local meetup 3 months before the talk as the introduction to my usual talk. The audience was engaged and I got positive feedback so I decided to use it.

I used vivid details to help making the story memorable like a real cafe in Sydney and I always described the story from the point of view of one individual: Stevo.

The metaphor took about 10 minutes of my 30 minutes presentation--and three times I moved from the metaphor to more technical details. The last one would was a start of a more technical analysis of the problem.

When I wrapped up the presentation I referenced the metaphor one last time to close off the talk and as a reminder of its purpose.

## Get feedback

One month before going to the conference I had three public rehearsal scheduled.

One at a local meetup, one at my office and one at our office in Sydney. It was great to receive feedback and I adjusted things aware of contradicting feedback--some people wanted more technical details other less--some liked the section I dedicated to mindset others suggested to reduce it. Eventually you're by yourself and need to decide what to do.

I removed jokes about public figures seen as villains because that might not relate with or upset the audience--I instead used popular movies villains.

A few weeks before the conference I was thinking to ask the audience to fill an anonymous poll with their background related to the topic of my talk to hone the presentation for their needs but understandably I couldn't mail out all the attendees and using twitter and the local mailing list would have left some people out and I lead to misleading information.

In hindsight I wish I sent the poll out just for the sake of general information.

## Divide the presentation in bits

I used a series of post-it notes to indicate the areas of the presentation. This was helping me rehearse portions of the talk and also have a mental model of the points without having to memorize a script or read one.

I was reharsing the presentation in bits--then the whole ensuring it would fit in the 30 minutes time slot.

I had a basic script used as the backbone and started by reading it to check the rough time. I was also planning to read the script at the conference but then I found out research of how disengaging that is for the audience.

It does affect you when you have someone looking at you in the eyes rather then reading on a computer. In hindsight I wish I did I better job looking at the whole audience more rather then the first few rows. Next time.

## Reharse reharse reharse

People asked if I memorized a script but the answer is no. I just rehearsed so much that exposing those bits was pretty natural. The initial set of presenter notes quickly became outdated and they where more like indicators of what I intended to say rather then what I wanted to say. I often used different wording but when some key sentences sounded off I wrote them down on a piece of paper, strike them and wrote the sentence that I wanted to use.

A month before the conference I started rehearsing twice a week. At first I was recording my voice only and listening back to it while preparing dinner. Then I started using the laptop camera to see myself--I am so glad I did--I noticed a few weird movements like I kept my hands in my pockets or touching my face or keeping hands in front of my mouth.

I wrote those "bad behaviours" down on a piece of paper to stop doing that. It worked.

When I rehearsed the full presentation I timed the bits to help measure each section appropriately. In hindsight I didn't do a very good job since I wrapped up 5 minutes earlier... I'll have to look at the video to find out on what part I went faster. In general I've heard conference organizers are happier if you finish early rather then late--obviously not too early. I had a couple of section that I was ready to ditch in case I was going long--the remote had a timer that was of great help in finding out how I was doing.

Rehearsing by myself helped a lot but doing it in front of people was the real deal. At a point I was thinking to print out faces to look at while rehearsing but it turned out to be unnecessary.

I used OSX Keynote and at first I used my iPhone 6 as the remote--as well as for reading notes. While rehearsing the iPhone always felt bulky and one time it jumped off my hands--I grabbed it while it was floating in the air--I didn't wanna test my good luck on stage and I bought a remote.

**Don't dump data to the audience but rather ideas.**


## On stage

I assumed the resolution was 16:9 so I already optimized for that but the day prior the conference the excellent organizers gave us time to check the connection and slides on the stage. I confirmed the font and images where not scaling bad--they did on a projector in one of my rehearsals, the remote had a green pointer that didn't have a great contrast but luckily I wasn't planning to use it too much, I found out there was going to be one track and around 300/350 people listening to my talk... that felt pretty overwhelming. I never spoke to an audience of 300 people before. People coming to this conference were paying between 200$ to 500$ and I thought it would have been disrespectful to come unprepared--but felt good about the amount of rehearsals I did so the overwhelm feeling didn't last long.

The morning before my talk I did one last run--I felt like I wanted to change a ton of stuff and I didn't--I decided to get feedback on what I worked on.

During the talk the audience screens went black 3 or 4 times for some A/V problem--I stopped because I was worried the audience would get lost without visual cues but I was able to recover pretty quickly thanks to not memorizing the script. If I did I would have to rewind the mental disk and go back to the point where I stopped talking.
