## Preamble

In the Scrum Guide a sprint retrospective has a definition with--in my opinion--more then a backdrop of linear thinking. There is not mention to the word reflection contrary to the 12th Agile Principle. I sense an assumption that all problems have a solution ignoring the nature of wicked issues (problems you can influence but not fix) and their entanglement with ordered system (problems you can fix). I think I will write a blog post about a Sprint Retrospective is not an Agile Retrospective.
