I am writing to help people relocating for work from Sydney Australia to New York City--I'll assume you already have a job already if you don't this post won't help you get one.

In February 2014 I moved to New York City after living in Sydney for 7 years--to get a gut feeling for it I visited the city for two weeks starting at the end of August until September 2013 and then one week in November 2014. This was important to understand if I could balance the things I liked and disliked about the city.

During contract negotiation I checked the rental prices and asked adjustments to my paycheck to afford the area and category building I wanted.

## Forget washer/dryer
 
Old buildings have strict laws that prohibit installing washer/dryer in the unit and because of the general lack of space in New York City they are considered a luxury--if you are lucky the building might have one in the basement or to share with a few floors but don't worry you have dry cleaners at almost every corner as well as clear pickup services.

## Finding an apartment

When you relocate to New York neighborhoods are extremely different sometime one or two blocks distance can mean a lot in terms of noise, good vibe, safety, food venues and transport--without knowing the one you like you will be just guessing.

Be careful not to lease in a location you dislike because the lease is a legal contract that you can't just terminate like in Sydney--here you are legally bound to pay the rent until the end of the contract or the owners will sue you. When speaking with locals about walking out of a lease they don't consider it an option.

To avoid signing a lease you could search on craigslist but it's a bit of a zoo but I've heard of people finding decent accommodations if your budget is limited and you don't mind roommates.

I stayed at two airbnb for a total of 5 weeks. This allowed me to triage areas and avoid making a rushed decision on where to move. I decided I wanted to be close to my office, I was in the heart of downtown brooklyn with tons of subways stopping within 2 blocks from me, the brooklyn bridge park and good food shopping.

Another option is to give an agent your budget and requirements and they will show you as many places as possible in a day or two for you to pick one.

## The commute

I was less then 20 minutes door to door to my office which in New York City is pretty good considering the average is double that.
In about 30 minutes I could get to any mid-town venue, 40 minutes to central Park.

First thing you must get a social security number, to do that you need a I94 and your passport.

You should then open a bank account, without a social you will need to provide your ozzie address but that's ok. I suggest you wait to apply for a credit card until you get a few paychecks in or you might get declined like I did. Something bank didn't tell me is the more you apply for credit cards the lower your score becomes. As a foreign with no credit history in the US we start pretty low.

I suggest you to get an idea of the area you
