It's like when in the 1700s aritocrats with minimal military background were elected officers and lead others with no experience on the field--some mistakes could be paid in their subordinate lifes.

Having a CTO or a director with no technical background is no difference--before becoming a director or a CTO you need to work at least 10 years on the field and you need to know what you're talking about.


~~Ultimately the people working on it so make sure you have a policy to receive feedback perhaps anonymously since your company managers might be using management by fear without you knowing.~~

Make sure you collect developers feedback on the subject and follow up. Internal knowledge sharing would be the best if the organization is healthy but in a dysfunctional one internal politics and pride will not facilitate it so a director or tech lead might disregard suggestions coming from a developer below them in the company hierarchy.

~~Having external consultants mentor your technical executives might be an effective way but~~ 


~~Managers without years of hands on experience creating maintainable software or successfully refactoring unmaintainable ones won't recognize the problem and will be unable to help their teams. Having 10 years experience means nothing when it's a one year design less experienced repeated 10 times.~~
