One year ago joined a company in New York City as a senior developer -- a few hours after starting I noticed something wrong with my development manager. After working 13 years I started to recognize misbehaviour but I decided to hold on and see where this was going in the same way you reach for a higher cliff when you are top roping or when you try a new recipe -- you go out of your confort zone to learn something valuable the next time you are in the same situation.

If you saw somebody in this meeting stepping on the table, pulling pants down and taking a shit on the table you'd be outraged I think. That is because you are a person, and there are rules that you take for granted and you'd be surprised perhaps enraged by somebody taking a shit on the table while talking about the meeting subject.

When you see unmaintainable code you are not affected as much because you do not know what unmaintainable code is. I do because I used to write it, and over 14 years of self learning I got to a point where I know how to avoid that and I would like my peers to do the same.
