It's like saying that volleyball is like beach volleyball. They're very different sports that require very different skillset. Of course they share some foundational concepts ie. if you're tall. But on the beach you gotta shuffle and move around a lot more then in indoor volleyball. You play 2 vs 2 instead of 6 vs 6.

This comparison deserves a separate post about that topic and it's not the focus of this.
