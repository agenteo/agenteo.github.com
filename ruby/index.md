Ruby in an object oriented [programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org) I worked professionally since 2005.

I find Ruby's core libraries and syntax helps focusing on the problem at hand rather then getting in the way. Another thing I love is the good test coverage in all popular libraries and it's well understood that open source pull requests come with automated tests. The community is generally helpful to newcomers, promote diversity and sponsor events.

At my right Matz (Ruby's inventor):
