There are many complexity frameworks out there, HSD and Cynefin come to mind.

Around Cynefin, it can be used in two main ways:
* as a sense-making framework
* as a categorization framework

I'll focus on the second option but you should be aware that there is large power in the first one too.

## Conclusion

It’s important for the group to zoom in and zoom out, find an adeguate granularity and determine if what we’re tackling in our Retrospectives is a clear, complicated or complex issue. Adaptive action helps with that but when we're missing the "so what” we don’t have time to look for patterns and we can only react with linear thinking.
