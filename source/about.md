I was born and educated in Italy but I lived one third of my adult life in Australia and the US. I am currently working as principal software engineer at Pivotal Labs.

I traveled to several countries usually for a couple of weeks--this has been a great opportunity to meet locals and learn their culture and history--when I return I summarize each trip in a short movie.

## Work experience

**I have 17 years of experience in Europe, Australia and the United States leading teams and building commercial software** such as: call centers, government event sites, online shops, brand sites with social components, memory video games, content management systems, health providers apps, rider apps, online tv services and more.

In 2001 I spent the first years working on desktop and web apps with VB5 and then C# .NET then for more then 10 years web apps using Ruby and Javascript--recently mobile development with React Native, Swift for iOS and Java Spring on the backend.

**As a principal consultant I gather requirements from stakeholders and translate them in to user stories, introduce and coach agile methodologies like TDD and pair programming to teams of 4 to 10 developers.**

## Current career trajectory

**I want to help organizations embracing a growth mindset and introduce a sustainable work process to deliver business value.** 

To achieve that I communicate with the whole organization to gather their needs and priorities, incrementally architect software with product owners, facilitate [agile retrospectives](/topics/retrospectives/) to generate insight, mentor and coordinate the work of teams following agile methodologies.
