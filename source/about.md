I was born and educated in Italy. I lived a significant slice of my adult life in Australia and proudly became a citizen. I am currently working in New York City.

Since 2001 I enjoyed working in different domains: call center applications, government event sites, online shops, brand sites with social components, memory video games, content management systems.
 
I keep my skills updated by checking major blog articles and [reading books](/reading) about programming languages, code standards, agile methodologies.
