This is an activity to use at the start of your retro when you set the stage.

I'd use this on a group new to the prime directive or a group that doesn't feel safe.

## Activity introduction

The facilitator reads the directive and explains that by accepting it the group will make retrospective a more constructive and effective environment. 

Instead of asking the group for the directive acceptance with a verbal yes tell them we will spend 10 minutes challenging the directive. 

Given them two minutes to remember of an episode in their previous job where they believe the prime directive could not be applied. Read the directive highlighting the **givens** portion.

After the two minutes--or less--ask them to summarize the episode on a post-it note. If people believe in the directive you can ask for an episode where the directive was applicable.

Once done writing ask them to reflect how these **factors** affected that episode:
 
 * what was known at the time of the episode/incident
 * what were that person or group skills and abilities
 * what resources--time, team size, bandwidth--were available
 * what was the situation at hand

The root causes to these factors if what we're looking for in this retrospective.

## Activity debriefing

Give a few moments and then ask if they still think the best job wasn't done given these **factors** or if perhaps they didn't know how to answer about the **factors**.

Now is the time to ask each participants if they accept the prime directive for today's retrospective.

### Skeptics in the group

Remind the group that it's ok to still think the directive doesn't apply.

Ask if they are ok sharing the episode with the group and try to understand the factors. Also acknowledge that there are rare and extreme situations where individuals might purposely sabotaging projects and use an unprofessional conduct.

Ask them if they are ok **putting aside their biases and accept the directive for the duration of today's retrospective**.

If they accept thank them if they refuse there must be a deeper issue that needs to be tackled.

**If it's an individual I'd say continue the retrospective and keep an eye on his behavior and follow-up one-on-one afterwards**.

**If the majority of the group feels that way it's better to call the retrospective off and investigate further on the root cause of that tension.**
