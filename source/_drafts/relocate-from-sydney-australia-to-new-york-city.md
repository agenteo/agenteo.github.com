In February 2014 I moved to New York City after living in Sydney for 7 years, I am writing this to help people about to make the same move--if you don't have a job this post won't help you get one.

## Probing

Before moving I was able to visit NYC twice and get a gut feeling for the massive amount of change I would be signing up for: first for two weeks starting at the end of August until September 2013 and then one week in November 2014--this helped me understand there was a positive balance between things I liked and disliked and have less surprises if I moved.

## Food

Coming from Australia food shopping in NYC was shockingly bad--regulation are way more permissive so if you care about what you eat you might need to keep your eyes open. Milk for example contains and are way more 

## Cost of living

Sydney is expensive but NYC is more expensive so prepare to compromise on work proximity, size or number of flatmates of your rental. Prices are only going up so check [Zillow](http://zillow.com) to get an idea. During contract negotiation I checked the rental prices and asked adjustments to my paycheck to afford the area and category building I wanted.

### Forget washer/dryer
 
Old buildings have strict laws that prohibit installing washer/dryer in the unit and because of the general lack of space in New York City they are considered a luxury--if you are lucky the building might have one in the basement or to share with a few floors but don't worry you have dry cleaners at almost every corner as well as clear pickup services.

## Finding an apartment

Each New York City neighborhood is extremely different. Sometime one or two blocks distance can mean a lot in terms of noise, good vibe, safety, food venues and transport--without knowing the one you like you will be just guessing.

Be careful not to lease in a location you dislike because the lease is a legal contract that you can't just terminate like in Sydney--here you are legally bound to pay the rent until the end of the contract or the owners will sue you. When speaking with locals about walking out of a lease they don't consider it an option.

To avoid signing a long term lease you could search on craigslist and commit for 2 or 3 months--you usually still have to give the first month in advance and one month bond. Craigslist is a bit of a zoo but I've heard of people finding decent accommodations if your budget is limited.

I stayed at two airbnb for a total of 5 weeks. This allowed me to triage areas and avoid making a rushed decision on where to move. I decided I wanted to be close to my office, I was in the heart of downtown brooklyn with tons of subways stopping within 2 blocks from me, the brooklyn bridge park and good food shopping.

Another option is to give a real estate agent your budget and requirements and he will show you as many places as possible in a day or two so you can pick one and move in as soon as possible.

## The commute

I was one train and less then 20 minutes door to door to my office which in New York City is pretty good considering the average is double that. In about 30 minutes I could get to any mid-town venue, 40 minutes to central Park.

Keep in mind the metro works 24/7 but there are always change of service after 11pm and weekend and during the weekend--keep an eye out for papers stuck outside the station or use the CityMapper app that alerts when there are change of service.


## Banking and credit cards

You should open a bank account as soon as possible, without a social security number you will need to provide your ozzie address which is ok. I suggest you wait to apply for a credit card until you get a few paychecks in or you might get declined like I did. Nobody told me that when a credit card application is denied your credit score goes down--if you apply for another card and is declined the credit score goes even lower and as a foreign citizens with no credit history in the US you already start pretty low.
