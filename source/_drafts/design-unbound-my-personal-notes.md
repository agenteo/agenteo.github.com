>> "Visionary, optimistic, and opportunistic, design is different then instrumental problem solving."

Another bit that I love is

>> "we use design as a means for speculating how things could be"

The book intention is to talk about a new tool set to design for emergence. And that resonate with me since too often I see folks talking about product design as a liner process which produces a requirement document which someone else's--engineering--follows to build the product.

So this is waterfall with a mask.

By the way I am far from being an Agile zealot, I don't think there is anything wrong with a waterfall approach in certain contexts. I'll expand on this topic in a separate post.

## A Cambrian moment

... a moment of rapid change, intense diversification, and evolution

"This is a white water world--a world of dynamics flows in which so much of what we do and know is radically contingent on the context at the moment one is looking at it, or operating in it. The shifting of structural plates of connectivity through new digital technologies has created a world broadly connected, rapidly changing, and radically contingent."

## What?

You might reply: "What? Be concrete!". So I think human interactions must have always--well at some point in homo sapiens--been a Complex adaptive system. The big game changer is the network connectivity. Think:

* dating apps that track where you walk and offer the opportunity to strike a conversatin with a person you might not see again
* social apps that allows to be connected in instants to people around the globe--I am thinking the awareness we have of individual stories during the 2020 Australian bushfires or the Hong Kong protests. Yes mass media gave some of those insights but not network access.
* the video channels that show and teach people how to cook, change hard disk on a 2013 Macbook Air ... the comments and the human interactions there

Say you come up with a product design for idea X.

Say you build an app--or web site--for idea X.

You can bet most folks that have access to your idea X app/webpage can compare it with other similar things. Will comment on it. Will share it with their network. Access to material about it.

## So what?

So the book intention is to talk about a new tool set to design for emergence. So read on.

## Four forms of societal organization TIMN

TIMN by David Ronfeldt [describes four forms of societal organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBulH9_04vc). Tribes, Instituions, Markets and Networks. Ronfeldt says one form **does not replace the other** but rather they build on each other.

To clarify this point I am using some slides from the video linked above:

The author suggests:

>> "Given how the networked societal form is radically transforming the other three forms, we propose that the TIMN framework is better articulated as TIM to the Nth power where N--the network form--operates to exponentially influence the other three forms."

# Seeing the world anew: a third window (Ecology)

>> "Reductionism is the most natural thing in the world to grasp. It's simply the belief that 'a whole can be understood completely if you understand its parts, and the nature of their sums' No one in her left brain could reject reductionism"

The books taks about Newtown and Darwin as two ways to look and act in the world. Moving from Newtonian to Darwinian is a step in the right direction but it doesn't take us far enough. The book suggests we use a third epistemological lens through which to view and act in the world.

>> "Shifting from Newtonian mechanics, to Darwin's evolutionary biology, to process ecology is a shift from immutable laws; to processes that are associated with linear development of single organisms in their communities; to complex systems processes that are dependent upon the vibrant exchange and flow of energy and matter between many organisms, their communities, and their environment"
