I was born and educated in Italy but I lived one third of my adult life in Australia and the US. I am currently working as principal software engineer at Pivotal Labs.

I traveled to several countries usually for a couple of weeks--this has been a great opportunity to meet locals and learn their culture and history--when I return I summarize each trip in a short movie. 

## Objectives

**I want to help organizations embracing a growth mindset and introduce a sustainable work process to deliver business value.** To achieve that I communicate with the whole organization to gather their needs and priorities, incrementally architect software with product owners, mentor and coordinate the work of teams following agile methodologies. 

## Work experience

**I have 15 years of experience in Europe, Australia and the United States building commercial software** such as: call centers, government event sites, online shops, brand sites with social components, memory video games, content management systems, health providers, online tv services and more. I spent the first years working with .NET and for the last 10 I've been using with Ruby and Javascript.

**I've lead and mentored teams between 4 to 10 developers.**

I keep my skills updated by checking major blog articles and [reading books](/reading) about programming languages, social interactions, management and agile methodologies. I write on my blog about a series of different [topics](/topics). You can find out the full details of my [professional experience on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agenteo).
