I am writing to help people relocating for work from Sydney Australia to New York City I wish I had somebody telling me this before I moved. I'll assume you have a job already, if you don't this post won't help you get one.

In February 2014 I moved to New York City after living in Sydney for 7 years--to get a gut feeling for it I visited the city for two weeks at the end of August and September 2013 and then one week in November 2014.

While discussing my job offer I checked the rental prices and negotiated adjustment to be able to afford the area and the building utilities I wanted. Unlike Australia in NYC you won't get washer / drier in the unit, if you are lucky the building has one that you share with your floor or the entire place. They are extremely rare extremely expensive comodities, I understand old buildings have strict laws and do not permit it. If you don't have one don't worry you have way more dry cleaners then in Australia, so if you are fine jamming all your stuff in one bag and walking to the place. There are also services that pick up and delivery but I haven't got experience with those.

When you move some people like to get in a place as soon as possible, I guess everybody does but that means you will have to compromise on what you want. I stayed at two airbnb for a total of 5 weeks. This allowed me to triage areas and avoid making a rush decision. I decided I wanted to be close to my office, I was in the heart of downtown brooklyn with tons of subways stopping within 2 blocks from me. I was about 20 minutes door to door to my office, and about 30 minutes to any mid-town venue, 40 minutes to central Park.

First thing you must get a social security number, to do that you need a I94 and your passport.

You should then open a bank account, without a social you will need to provide your ozzie address but that's ok. I suggest you wait to apply for a credit card until you get a few paychecks in or you might get declined like I did. Something bank didn't tell me is the more you apply for credit cards the lower your score becomes. As a foreign with no credit history in the US we start pretty low.

I suggest you to get an idea of the area you
