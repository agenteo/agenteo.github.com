Recently I was on a reocurring call with Human System Dynamics (HSD) associates and friends where a voluneer shares a wicked issue they have and then listen to questions without answering. **The questions are open ended, not disguised advice, beyond the knowledge of the asker**.

I hope these questions will help you see a next step for your Agile Retrospective missing reflection.

>> Answers have short shelf lives in complex systems, and a good question can last a lifetime.
>> -Glenda Eoyang

**After that the person considers a next wise action that is within control, reasonable, promising, short term response**.

The groups follows HSD simple rules:

* Stand in inquiry
    - Turn judgement in to curiosity
    - Turn conflict in to shared exploration
    - Turn defensiveness into self-reflection
    - Turn assumptions in to questions
* Search for true and useful
* Find the energy in difference
* Zoom in and zoom out
* Connect with stories and impacts
* Celebrate life

## What is a wicked issue?

Here’s how HSD defines it:

* Many levels
* Many stakeholders
* Massive interdependencies
* Fuzzy boundaries
* Repeating but never exactly
* No root cause
* Cannot be solved, but can be influenced

Here are some graphics I created to explain the process in a micro talk I gave:

## My wicked issue

>> Retrospectives are times to reflect with your team. You can use Adaptive Action, but many people jump from WHAT to NOW WHAT. They miss the time of reflection.

## The questions I received

* GE : What does time have to do with it?
* JK: What kind of false time lines do we put on ourselves and our teams?
* GE : What if you started with the SO WHAT and left out the WHAT and NOW WHAT onece?
* Royce: Where else do you see that lack of reflection
* GE : How many different tools and models exist to support SO WHAT?
* GE : What do feelings have to do with it?
* BMC : Are there other spaces or processes where the team is capable of doing reflection? What’s different?
* JJ : If you can apply only ONE simple rule (HSD) to trigger off the introspection, what would it be?
* SB : Building on Michaels….is there judgment usually at play?
* Royce: What kinds of invitation do you have and how do people know what to reflect on?
* GE : Are there some people who are better at SO WHAT than others are?
* BMC : Are they aware that they are skipping the step?
* SB : where  might they do so what elsewhere?
* JK: How does our current educational system teach and promote reflection?
* Leslie : What pattern(s) are these reflection times intended to generate?
* EMN : Have you worked with a team that does  reflection intuitively and what is different about that team?
* Royce: Is engaging in retrospective a finite game or an infinite game?
* MKS : What is your So What on the teams not doing a So What?
* JJ : What is the "fear" behind the skipping Reflection?
* SB : What’s the normative truth about the so what?
* GE : How is the retrospective about individual and how about team performance?
* JJ : Is time/urgency more important than quality?
* GE : How would a retrospective work if it were totally in inquiry?
* Royce: How do your team members understand or use the inquiry practices?
* SB : what do they really want to know?
* EMN : Are there any fun games that require reflection?  
* GE : What would a prospective look like?
* Royce: How would we turn some of the models and methods into games?
* MKS : Would the team even do a retrospective, if given the choice?
* GE : What would happen if you took this wicked issue to the group?
* GE : What does it have to do with learning?
* Leslie : What role do questions play in a retrospective?
* Royce: What’s the difference between an invitation and a “rule”?
* GE : Who wins the retrospective game?
* GE : Where besides Agile world does this issue happen?
* SB : What are the simple rules that govern how the retrospective is done now?

I enjoyed this session, it was comforting hearing similar questions to the ones I am asking and the different ones that I didn't explore yet.

Those questions aren’t "disguised advice” but tokens to get to a deeper insight.

After that there was a conversation with many interesting exchanged, somebody raised a good point about the **downside of too much reflection**. That made me realise how some people have been burned--or are concerned--by analysis-paralysis and might be leaning towards action/reaction. **That's why I find the adaptive action cycle step "Now what?" such a natural and important one**.

## Now what?

The question that stuck most for me was "why do you care about this?". It took me a little to reply and the answer is I want to leave the world in a better place than I've found it, and fostering reflection is for me a way to do that.

**Clearing out why I care gave me more energy in making Agile Retrospectives the tool they're meant to be and not just a checkbox.**

How did those questions resonate with you? Do they inspire you to a wise next step on your Agile Retrospectives that are lacking reflection? Do they make you see your current issue differently?
