A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...

Many folks love themed retrospectives a popular one I often see is around Star Wars. Here's my take at it and at the end of the article I explain my beef with the #funretrospectives approach.

I'd advice to make sure your group is somewhat familiar with the franchise BEFORE your decide to go with this approach.

To simplify this article I'll describe the container for this approach:

- a team of 5/6 people involved (better if somewhat familiar with the Star Wars franchise)
- two weeks iteration
- a Retrospective focused on "what can we make to make our work even more effective"

Here's my take:

Having Kerth's Prime directive printed in a Star Wars scrolling text to set the mood. There is a deep purpose behind the Prime directive, you can read my toughts in two extensive articles on [Challenging the directive](1) and [Dissecting the directive](2).

I then continue setting the stage, to allow the group to connect with each other and with the last iteration.

I am using a variation of ESVP, using at the bottom of the spectrum Finn a good folk forced in to storm trooper forced in to that, but with potential for redemption aka re-engagement. The reason is to ensure we don't create a us vs them that is predominant in the franchise.

**Which identify rapresents how you feel about this retrospective?**

- Storm Trooper: I don't wanna be here but this is what I've always done.
- Mandalorian: Not sure why we're here. This is an ok break in-between bounty hunting contracts.
- Rebel Alliance member: I am here to work together for a better future for the galaxy!
- Jedi: I want to leave no stone unturned and bring more light to the next iteration.

I am using a variation of the "pick a form of transportation that represents the last iteration for you".

**Pick a space ship that indicates how the last iteration was for you**:

- AT-AT
- Millenium Falcon
- X-Wing

You can explore the differences, why people picked their choice, or simply acknowledge them.

Then I create questions to gather data that connect to the metaphor and to the team. This is what I mostly see in the "Fun Star Wars Retrospectives". 

To prevent bounty hunters contract, it's our policy to avoid people's names and rather point to systems and sub-systems. ie. rather then saying: "Luke messed up the database on Monday" we should use "the database got Error Code: 1117. Too many columns after adding one column to its 1699".

- What was turning off our hyperdrive? (frustrating)
- Did we blow up the Death Star? How?
- What felt like a trap? Why was it a trap? (surprise)
- Where was the force bringing the best out of us? Why?
- Where was the dark side bringing the worst out of us? Why?

## Pattern matching

Let's move those cards on to the galaxy map, do we see any patterns? Do they have names?

## What shall we focus on?

How can we make sure our team works more effectively? Do we want this Agile Retrospective outcome to destroy a tie-fighter or defeat the empire?

Let's reflect for 5 minutes and think of ideas that can reduce the negative patterns and radiate the positives.

How can we come up with a thoughtful but actionable plan?

Here we're hinting at the group if we want to focus on simple, complicated or complex issues. I use a Star Wars metaphor for that. See my Cynefin helps retrospectives article for more background on difference between these domains.

If the group replies: "we defeat the Empire by destroying all Tie fighters" you might need to to explore linearity and complexity with them. Short answer is, even if you destroy tie-fighters they'll build more. To free the galaxy, at some point we will need to shift the Empire power.

## Use the FORCE in your next action item!

Make sure the plan follows the: FORCE acronym:

- First step: what is the first step of this plan?
- Observable: what is an observable result that the first step is positively influencing the system? What is an observable result of it negatively influencing the system?
- Responsibility: who is responsible to check on this plan progress?
- Controllable: is the first step something within the team control zone?
- Energy: how much energy do we have for this first step?

Associate FORCE action items to the patterns that emerged. Use the acronym to get an idea of what action is the one to carry over. Perhaps use a poll to decide which one.

Once that action is defined you can start closing your Retrospective.

## How was the time spent in this Retrospective?

0 - Jar Jar Binks - This was a complete waste of time 
1 - Jabba the Hutt - I learned one thing, but this was mostly a waste of time
2 - Bobba Fett - I got paid back for the effort I put in to this
3 - Han Solo - I got a lot more out of this then I expected!
4 - Luke Skywalker - This was amazing!

One idea that would have made you vote one point higher, and one thing you liked about today Retro.

And boom, you have your Agile Retrospective.
