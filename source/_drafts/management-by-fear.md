One year ago I joined a company in New York City as a senior developer and my development manager--let's call it Seamus--was practising management by fear.

I think it's worth writing about this to remind me the phases of what happened and to define pillars that should always be present in a healthy organization. I hope to help people or organizations in a similar situation to make swift decisions.

PILLAR 1 **you should always feel free to ask questions and you should always get polite answers or followups**

Shortly after I started I was in a meeting with 3 other developers, a director of technology and Seamus. It was meant to be an agile release planning as well as an iteration planning with no product owner--I won't focus on the lack of process--after being briefed with the product vision I started asking questions like "How much data do we need to migrate?" and "Who's the product owner?" and "How many requests is this meant to support?", Seamus gave away his discomfort changing face color from white, to red, to pompei red, to purple and cut me off saying that he was going to be the product owner and the rest of the questions were irrelevant. The shocking part was he was backed up by a director of technology sitting next to him that said something along the lines of "let's not focus on those details" and none of the other 3 developers spoke up which made me think there was something wrong with me? I felt the lack of questions from their side was a symptom of inexperience, insecurity and fear. Don't let somebody with a title higher then yours silence you up.

PILLAR 2 **you say things in front of the entire team not behind closed doors**.

Sometime Seamus would not answer your question in front of the team instead you were politely invited to go in a room alone with him so he could attack you or ask you to be on his side. He said he wanted us to ask questions but his reaction was giving away his discomfort. After being in such a situation with another developer--let's call him Luke--I walked out with him for coffee and started talking about something Seamus weird management style and the lack processes he said "I know exactly what you mean". I felt relieved I could talk about a subject that I felt nobody else was open to talk about and I wasn't alone anymore, Luke worked with Seamus for three months before I joined and his patience was running out, he didn't tell me at the time but he already contacted human resources.

PILLAR 3: **do not be afraid of what you don't know**.

The feeling I had was the company technical level was mediocre and Seamus with an above mediocre technical level so he was getting away with a mix of buzzwords and rhetoric because nobody knew what he was talking about and nobody would dare to ask in fear of sounding stupid.

PILLAR: **trust**

When Seamus was not in meeting he liked to micromanage, even some novice found that ineffective because it was purely driven by need to control rather then mentor. It was very ineffective because after setting the course he would not be there to follow-up. With people more experienced that would just bring up more questions and he did not like that, one episode I was assigned a task and after reporting back it was not possible he asked me to look again and I did producing the same result, he then said I was wrong and that he used the feature before and he decided to look in to it. Turns out I was right (it doesn't take much to read a utility documentation to find out the feature was not there) but he came up with a recently introduced debug option to back up that he was right... it was hearthbreaking. When later he reported to the director about that discovery and the change of plans that required he didn't praise me for the find, he took the credit.

You could write a book about trust in your workplace, but I am just gonna say

PILLAR 4: **beware of fake distinctions created to hide fear**

2 months went on and Seamus was still product owner of a product that had a real stakeholder on the floor above us. When asked about our processes and when I was comparing us to other teams Seamus would cut me off saying they don't know what they are doing, we are the better team we are the one building the core of this product that will bring money to the company. We were not all that special, Seamus was just afraid to compare with another team and by putting himself (and the team) above was trying to avoid that.

PILLAR 5: **your colleagues should demonstrate empathy about your problems and not only concern about theirs**.

Seamus was assigning us tasks to work on and we didn't have a deployment server as we were told that our QA person a sweet girl that I'll call Mush would have to setup the application on her machine and test it there. She felt upset because she couldn't do her job because she had to ask us developers to setup the application each time she was doing testing. Seamus then said she should be writing capybara tests and then we would make them pass. This felt unreal, way over amateur week and I spoke to another team lead about this and he acknowledged the problem but was not interested in being involved at all. He was fine as long as his little corner was fine.


PILLAR 6: **people should not cry or feel helpless**

Around 2 months after I started, 6 months after Seasmus and Luke started we were a team of 6: me, Luke two other junior developers and a designer. Mush resigned and I remember her crying in one of the last closed door with Seamus, later she told me "I told Seamus he wasted my time here". Two developers also resigned, if Seamus was the reason for their departure I don't know I was scared to ask and that's when I decided I was going to actively do something about this. A new developer joined let's call him Gerard, he was put to work on a part of this "project" that was not specified at all, he would later tell us he was sitting there doing nothing. The other 2 junior developers have been with the company for about 10 years when speaking with them about Seasmus they agreed he was a bad manager but they said there is nothing you can do about it. This was mind blowing, some people would take anything to pay the bills!

*PILLAR 7* **You only live once, work on something you love and set a deadline by when you either see change or leave.**

I decided to hold a little bit longer I wasn't sure for how long, no more then a month or two. I was curious to see where this was going in the same way you reach for a higher cliff when you are top roping or when you try a new recipe -- you go out of your comfort zone to learn something valuable for the next time you are in that situation. In the meantime I was setting my own goals experimenting with technologies, writing maintainable code and mentoring Luke but knowing these applications would never go live wasn't great for morale.

PILLAR 8: **leaving the office and having lunch should not be the best thing about your job**.

The discomfort Seamus created in the team made our bond really tight a sense of comradeship. The team was regularly going out for lunch, once before in my career I had this comradeship feeling were we all agreed the lunch break was the best part of that workplace. Seamus schedule didn't allow him to consistently have lunch and when he did he was sitting and being awkwardly silent or stare at you.

PILLAR 9: **if change is on the horizon, might be worth waiting for it**

I spoke with human resources about the issues with Seasmus they seemed receptive but didn't have a time line. The company was unable to take action, instead they hired another manager (a vice president) to oversee this and other situations. I was asked if I would feel comfortable speaking once a week to the VP to describe the evolving situation--I did but no action was taken--the VP wanted to collect more feedback. I was asked to approach team members and see if they would feel like talking to the VP about the situation. Not everyone felt comfortable and some wanted the VP to contact them first in fear of repercussions.

The VP did an excellent job collecting feedback from each team members, and gave one last chance to Seamus. I was actively looking at other jobs and I told the VP that so I was told me how long Seamus evaluation period was. To me it was unbearable to wait longer but the timeframe (1 month) was acceptable and I trusted the new VP.

The VP genuinely reviewed Seasmus behaviour, I was very skeptical about change people behaviour in such a short time. There was a review of Seasmus work to ensure it wouldn't be a black box after he was let go. The funny part is there was nothing worth keeping in the box and it really made me wonder how can someone get away for 7 months without any deliverables.

## Epilogue

It took about 5 months but in the end Seamus was fired, I was scarred and mistrusting a company organization that failed in supporting its employees when they most needed and colleagues only concerned with their corner.

The VP apologised to the team behind a closed door on behalf of the company, I would have much preferred it in open space with everyone instead Seamus disappeared and the company moved on hiring a new development manager and finally a product owner.

By the way I checked Seamus background and his jobs had an average duration between 6 to 9 months, I suspect this was not the first time that happened. Amazingly he had quite a few positive Linked in reviews, me and Luke joked about giving him a good review as long as he would leave. The people that were silent while Seamus was around didn't say much, some still support him saying he was misunderstood and that it was my fault for asking questions. This was very upsetting and it made me realize the kinda of people I have around.

## Conclusion

I hope you don't have to deal with such a toxic environment but if you are I hope the pillars and this story will help you. You might think you are the only one feeling a certain way about your Seamus but it's more likely there are others but are too scared to speak up. If your organization backs up your Seamus because of fear or ignorance it's time for you to get out of there.
