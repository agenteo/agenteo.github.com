I was born and educated in Italy. I lived a significant slice of my adult life in Australia and proudly became a citizen. I am currently working as principal software engineer at Pivotal Labs in Boulder, Colorado.

## Objectives

I want to help all organizational levels introducing a sustainable work process that deliver business value. To do that I communicate effectively from high level executives to software developers.

## Experience

I have 14 years of experience building commercial software in Europe, Australia and the United States in the following domains: call centers, government event sites, online shops, brand sites with social components, memory video games, content management systems, health providers, online tv services and more. I started my career worked with .NET for 3 years but for the last 10 years I've been working with Ruby and Javascript.

I've lead and mentored teams between 4 to 10 developers.
