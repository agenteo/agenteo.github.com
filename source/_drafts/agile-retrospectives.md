A key practice of agile development is to iterate. During each iteration we learn something and make some mistakes. Spend 10 seconds thinking about what happened during your last iteration. 1, 2, 3 ........... 10. Assume you had a time machine and could live that iteration again given what you know today. Would you repeat everything or would you change something? An agile retrospective is the closet thing we have to a time machine. It gives us time to stop our daily routine, reflect about what happened, gather insight and introduce experiments to adjust what in hindsight we realized didn't go so well.  

When you use the same retrospective format over and over your audience brains will get used to it and become disengaged.

One signal is individuals not participating in conversations while others are overtaking the stage. Another signals is a list of "action items" that never gets done and are constantly carried over to the next iteration.

## does your retrospective feel like a status meeting?

In this article I compare a popular--simple and pragmatic--retrospective to a more structured one that follows Derby and Larsen's book on Agile Retrospectives. I've seen the first one becoming stale, ineffective and easily hijack-able by management so I switched to the second one. I've also seen the first one working well in teams of 2/3 developers and in teams new to agile and retrospectives.

## Simple and pragmatic retrospective

If you're doing a retrospective it's very likely that this is what you're doing or were told to do.

>> The whole team gets in a room a facilitator is picked at random to ensure the coversation keeps going and then the whole group start adding last retrospective events to a whiteboard--or an electronic equivalent--with three columns:
* mad
* sad
* glad
representing the feeling that the event triggered **for that person**. Multiple variations of this exists ie. start, stop, continue but the root activity is the same. After the team is done adding items the facilitator kicks off the retrospectice by reviewing the results of the last retrospective and then start discussing the items on the board and asking if there is any "action item" to make that event better. An action item purpose is to prevent a sad event from happening again.

### Pro of this retro

* It's really simple to explain to people new to retrospectives
* Everybody's event is very likely to be--perhaps briefly--discussed
*  is very likely to be--perhaps briefly--discussed

The facilitator 

Structured retro is work.
