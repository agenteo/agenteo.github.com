Some time ago I joined a company as a software developer and my development manager--let's call it Seamus--was practising management by fear.

I think it's worth writing about this to remind me the phases of what happened and to define pillars that must be present in a healthy organization. I hope to help people or organizations in a similar situation to make swift decisions.

* PILLAR 1 **freedom to ask questions and get a polite answer**
* PILLAR 2 **speak in front of the team not behind closed doors**
* PILLAR 3: **don't be afraid of what you don't know**
* PILLAR 4: **trust and talent recognition**
* PILLAR 5: **beware of barriers created to hide fear**
* PILLAR 6: **colleagues should supportive not only concerned with their issues**
* PILLAR 7: **people should not cry or feel helpless**
* PILLAR 8: **having lunch should not be the best part of your job**
* PILLAR 9: **set a deadline to see change or leave**
* PILLAR 10: **if change is on the horizon consider waiting for it**

## PILLAR 1

### freedom to ask questions and get a polite answer

Shortly after I started I was in a meeting with 3 other developers, a director of technology and Seamus. It was meant to be an agile release planning as well as an iteration planning with no product owner--I won't focus on the lack of process--after being briefed with the product vision I started asking questions like "*How much data do we need to migrate?*" and "*Who's the product owner?*" and "*How many requests is this meant to support?*", Seamus gave away his discomfort changing face color from white, to red, to pompei red, to purple and shut me off saying that he was going to be the product owner and the rest of the questions were irrelevant. The shocking part was he was backed up by a director of technology sitting next to him that said something along the lines of "*let's not focus on those details*" and none of the other 3 developers spoke up which made me think there was something wrong with me. I initially thought they didn't ask questions because they knew all the answers but it was a symptom of inexperience, insecurity and fear. Don't let somebody with a title higher then yours silence you up.

## PILLAR 2

### you say things in front of the entire team not behind closed doors

Sometime Seamus would not answer your question in front of the team instead you were politely invited to go in a room alone with him so he could attack you or ask you to be on his side. He said he wanted us to ask questions but his reaction was giving away his discomfort. After being in such a situation with another developer--let's call him Luke--I walked out with him for coffee and started talking about Seamus management style and he said "I know exactly what you mean". I felt relieved I could talk about a subject that I felt nobody else was open to talk about and I wasn't alone anymore, Luke worked with Seamus for three months before I joined and his patience was running out, he didn't tell me at the time but he already contacted human resources.

## PILLAR 3

### do not be afraid of what you don't know

The feeling I had was the company technical level was mediocre and Seamus with an above mediocre technical level was getting away with a mix of buzzwords and rhetoric because nobody knew what he was talking about and nobody would dare to ask in fear of sounding stupid.

## PILLAR 4

### trust and talent recognition

When Seamus was not in meetings he liked to micromanage, that was ineffective because it was purely driven by need of control rather then mentor and after setting the course he would leave and not be there for follow-ups. Once I was assigned a task and after reporting back it was not possible he asked me to look again--I did thinking I made a mistake but came back with the same result--he then said I was wrong and that he used the feature before and I must have missed it so he decided to look in to it. Turns out the feature was not there but he came up with an impractical option to back up that he was right. When later he reported to the director about that change of plans he didn't say who actually found the problem he just took the credit for himself. If people don't trust you why should you trust them? People less experienced then you should not tell you how to do your job.

## PILLAR 4

### beware of barriers created to hide fear

2 months went on and Seamus was still product owner of a product that had a real stakeholder on the floor above us that we were not allowed to talk to. When asked about our processes and when I was comparing us to other teams Seamus would cut me off saying "*they don't know what they are doing, we are the better team we are the one building the core of this product that will bring money to the company*". We weren't all that special--Seamus was afraid to compare with another team so he created a separation between.

## PILLAR 5

### colleagues should supportive not only concerned with their issues

Seamus was assigning us tasks to work on but we didn't have a deployment server--we were told that our QA person a sweet girl that I'll call Mush would have to setup the application on her machine and test it there. She felt upset because she couldn't do her job but had to ask developers to setup the application each time she was doing testing. Seamus then said she should be writing automated tests and then we would make them pass. This lack of process and understanding was unreal so I spoke to another team lead to get his opinion and help--he acknowledged the problem but was not interested in being involved at all--he was fine as long as his little corner was fine.


## PILLAR 6

### people should not cry or feel helpless

Around 2 months after I started we were a team of 6: me, Luke two other junior developers and a designer. Mush resigned and I remember her crying in one of the last closed door meetings with Seamus, later she told me "*I told Seamus he wasted my time here*". Two developers also resigned, if Seamus was the reason for their departure I don't know I was scared to ask and that's when I decided I was going to actively do something about this. A new developer called Gerard joined to work on a part of this "project" that had no specifications at all--he would later tell us he was sitting there doing nothing. The other 2 junior developers have been with the company for about 10 years when speaking with them about Seasmus they agreed he was a bad manager but they said there is nothing you can do about it. This was mind blowing, some people would take anything to pay the bills!

## PILLAR 8

### leaving the office and having lunch should not be the best thing about your job

The discomfort Seamus created in the team made our bond really tight a sense of comradeship. The team was regularly going out for lunch, once before in my career I had this comradeship feeling were we all agreed the lunch break was the best part of that workplace. Seamus schedule didn't allow him to consistently have lunch and when he did he was sitting and being awkwardly silent or stare at you.


## PILLAR 7

### You only live once, work on something you love and set a deadline by when you either see change or leave

I spoke with human resources about Seamus and decided to hold a little bit longer... I wasn't sure for how long, no more then a month or two. I was curious to see where this was going in the same way you reach for a higher cliff when you are top roping or when you try a new recipe--you go out of your comfort zone to learn something valuable for the next time. In the meantime I was setting my own goals experimenting with technologies, writing maintainable code and mentoring Luke but knowing these applications would never go live wasn't great for morale.

## PILLAR 9

### if change is coming wait for it

The company was unable to take action, instead they hired another manager (a vice president) to oversee this and other situations. I was asked if I would feel comfortable speaking once a week to the VP to describe the evolving situation--I did but no action was taken--the VP wanted to collect more feedback. I was asked to approach team members and see if they would feel like talking to the VP about the situation. Not everyone felt comfortable and some wanted the VP to contact them first in fear of repercussions.

The VP collected feedback from team members and put Seamus on a timebound evaluation period. To me it was unbearable to wait longer but the timeframe (1 month) was acceptable and I trusted the new VP.

The VP genuinely reviewed Seasmus behaviour, I was very skeptical about change people behaviour in such a short time. They also reviewed Seasmus work to ensure if he was let go he wouldn't leave a knowledge void but there was nothing worth keeping.

## Epilogue

It took about 5 months but in the end Seamus was fired, I was scarred and mistrusting an organization that failed in supporting its employees when they most needed and colleagues only concerned with their interests.

The VP apologised to the team behind a closed door on behalf of the company. I would have preferred a transparent public announcement instead Seamus disappeared and the company moved on hiring a new development manager and finally a product owner.

Seamus background had an average job duration between 6 to 9 months so this was not the first incident. Amazingly he had quite a few positive Linked in reviews, me and Luke joked about giving him a good review as long as he would leave. The people that were silent while Seamus was around didn't say much, some still support him saying he was misunderstood and that it was my fault for questioning him.

## Conclusion

I hope you don't have to deal with such a toxic environment but if you are I hope the pillars and this story will help you make a swift decision.

**You might think you are the only one feeling a certain way but if you have a Seamus there are others feeling like you and they are scared to speak up**.

If your organization backs up your Seamus because of fear or ignorance it's time for you to get out of there.
